    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ideal-Modeling-Software-for-Animation-Professionals"><a href="#Ideal-Modeling-Software-for-Animation-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="Ideal Modeling Software for Animation Professionals"></a>Ideal Modeling Software for Animation Professionals</h2><p>Using software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for editing your videos ready for uploading or release is fast and effective but first you have to get your files ready to import. We will be talking about 3d model creation today which is the first step in 3D animation creation. There are many options out there with their own advantages and drawbacks as well as price points and additional support via tutorials and in some cases assets to help speed up the creation process.</p><p>In every case you can always just buy ready-made models for your animations but in doing that you lose the option and the flexibility to have a completely custom asset with the ability to alter when needed.</p><p>There are many steps to creating that perfect video and in time you will have your preferred method. We call this our workflow. Achieving a comfortable workflow is one of the most important and influential processes you will undergo as a creative artist, this is due to the fact even with the best ideas and all the drive in the world, if you struggle to translate that into a 3d model then it stays in your head and no one will see it.</p><p>With this in mind let’s look at some of the options available to us and how we can use them for this first most important step in our creative process. Remember to pick one that does not limit your creativity and gives you the tools you need to translate thought into visualization.</p><h2 id="ZBrush-by-MAXON"><a href="#ZBrush-by-MAXON" class="headerlink" title="ZBrush by MAXON"></a>ZBrush by MAXON</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/zbrush-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="zbrush by maxon"                ></p><p>Zbrush is what is considered an industry standard 3D modeling software and is one of the most used by many leading studios. This is a paid software with different versions meeting different needs depending on what you feel you need. You can create impressive 3d models with very high levels of detail without overusing your computer resources resulting in a stable and fluid working process. Zbrush is very powerful with many features, too many features to highlight in this guide but as an overview some features that can improve your process are:</p><ul><li>You can import or create alphas easily for micro detailing.</li><li>There is a live boolean to create unique items within your sculpts.</li><li>It’s very easy to use the Zremesher to create a new clean topology of your sculptures.<br> Dynamesh lets you work and retopo as you go so the sculpt retains detail.</li><li>Work with multiple levels of divisions at the same time with the Sub Divide tools.</li></ul><p>This is just a tiny scratch on the surface of what ZBrush can do. There are all the tools you need within this software to create an amazing jaw dropping model for your videos but this is a paid software which is important to remember when making the decision to go with this one as you will need animation and rigging software as well as in some cases a UV editor. Another thing to remember is system requirements depending on your setup. Minimum system requirements are as follows:</p><p><strong>For Windows:</strong></p><ul><li>64-bit Windows 10 or 11 .</li><li>Core 2 Duo or AMD equivalent with SSE2 technology or better.</li><li>4GB of ram with a strong recommendation for 6GB or more.</li><li>8GB of free hard drive space.</li><li>A graphics card with OpenGL 3.3 or higher and Vulkan 1.1 or higher.</li><li>Monitor with 32-bit color and a resolution of 1280x1024.</li><li>Mouse or Wacom compatible (WinTab API) pen tablet.</li></ul><p><strong>For Mac:</strong></p><ul><li>Mac OSX: 10.14 or above</li><li>Everything else is the same as above.</li></ul><p>Zbrush runs the same on Windows and Mac so there is no advantage over the other and the only real elements that you need to consider is your CPU and your RAM, A faster CPU with more cores will make this program run more stable and 16GB or RAM or more will also help with stability so if your running an older computer this will still work but you may be limited to pixel count but that is true for all 3D creation software.</p><h2 id="Autodesk-Maya"><a href="#Autodesk-Maya" class="headerlink" title="Autodesk Maya"></a>Autodesk Maya</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/autodesk-maya.jpg"                      alt="autodesk maya"                ></p><p>This guide wouldn’t be complete without introducing Maya, Maya is another industry standard for modeling but also offers animation and rigging tools meaning this covers a lot more ground that some of the other 3D modeling software.</p><p>Maya is very powerful but for this guide I will only be talking about the 3D modeling creation tools as I feel other topics need their own space but that said I think it is important to mention this is a complete workflow from creation to the exportation of your movie file into Filmora ready for editing and uploading to your audience.</p><p>Again this software has a list of features that is simply too large to cover so i will highlight some useful features for your creative process.</p><ul><li>Polygon modeling lets you create 3D models based on vertexes, edges and faces.</li><li>Nurbs modeling lets you create 3d models from geometric primitives and drawn curves</li><li>Sculpting tools allows you to create organic sculpts</li><li>Subdivision workflow for better performance in higher pixel counts</li><li>Built in UV editing</li><li>Orthopedic viewport so you can check dimensions from whichever side you need</li></ul><p>Again we are only scratching the surface of what Maya can do. Maya is capable of creating hyper realistic hard surface and organic models for use within animation and also provides all the tools needed to get a perfect rendering. Again system performance is important to consider when choosing software and the minimum requirements are as follows:</p><ul><li>Windows 10 or 11, macOS x or above and linux but see website for compatibility.</li><li>64-bit Intel or AMD multi-core processor with SSE4.2, M series Mac under rosetta 2.</li><li>8GB of RAM but 16GB or more is recommended.</li><li>7GB free disk space for the install.</li><li>Three-button mouse.</li><li>Graphics card please see website for compatibility</li></ul><p>This is a paid software and can be expensive so please consider this when choosing your desired workflow but also consider that this is a complete workflow right up to importing your video file into Filmora so the price may be justified compared to multiple software. Another thing to consider is you can mostly get the desired results you want without the use of a drawing tablet cutting even more cost.</p><h2 id="3DCoat-2022"><a href="#3DCoat-2022" class="headerlink" title="3DCoat 2022"></a>3DCoat 2022</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/3-coat-2022.jpg"                      alt="3 coat 2022"                ></p><p>3DCoat was first released in 2007 and has released constant updates inline with the 3D art community needs. Being a smaller team of developers it’s quite impressive what they have achieved as this is a fully featured 3D art software capable of creating very nice detailed models. When used with the likes of Daz 3D, Keyshot or similar animation software you can easily create the animation you are planning. This is not a full workflow but it is very close to one and the team are constantly releasing updates so one day it might be. You have the ability to UV your models as well as texture, paint and sculpt all within one program and this has one of the most impressive live retopo tools around called voxel modeling mode. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Easy texturing and PBR with the use of smart materials and a HDRL viewport.</li><li>Voxel sculpting with complex boolean operations and adaptive dynamic tessellation.</li><li>Classic polygonal modeling is fully supported and also supports splines and joints.</li><li>Auto-retopology with user-defined edge loops but also fast and easy manual tools.</li><li>Professional tools for creating and editing UV-sets.</li><li>Native global uniform unwrapping algorithms.</li><li>PBR and HDRL rendering for concept exporting.</li><li>Use of scripts for repetitive actions.</li><li>And many more.</li></ul><p>This is paid software but with many options to buy as well as unlimited learning period which you will have to take into consideration when you are deciding to take this in your workflow. And again another consideration is your hardware and 3DCoat is complex due to the complexity of their software , as a point of reference there website states they consider a Surface Pro as the minimal hardware needed to use there software, minimum system specs are as follows:</p><ul><li>64-Bit Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11, macOS 10.13 High Sierra or higher, Linux Ubuntu 20.04+</li><li>CPU m3 1.00 GHz,</li><li>4GB RAM</li><li>Intel HD Graphics 615</li><li>This will allow painting textures up to 2K and sculpting up to 1 million triangles</li></ul><p>What makes 3DCoat a good choice is the fact they have unlimited learning allowing you to journey into sculpting without putting any money in to start and in confection with other software it is very powerful.</p><h2 id="Blender"><a href="#Blender" class="headerlink" title="Blender"></a>Blender</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/blender-modeling-software.jpg"                      alt="blender modeling software"                ></p><p>So now it’s time to talk about Blender, the Blender institute set off with one main goal in mind and that was to put powerful tools for use with 3D and CG in the hands of artists in the form of free&#x2F;open-source software. This is commendable and they have in large achieved what they set out to do, not only can you sculpt or model in Blender you can also rig and animate and add VFX to your projects.</p><p>It’s impressive to see what you can do with free software and you will be able to achieve very good results. What you miss out on in the form of automation tools and boutique brushes and toolsets this makes up for in an ever-expanding community driven tutorials and guides. With this being free it doesn’t make sense to not have this installed even if you have a different workflow due to the ability to expand with new skills that may work their way into your daily task. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Render with impressive results thanks to cycles,</li><li>An extensive toolset for modeling, curves and retopology</li><li>Sculpting tools provide the power and flexibility needed in several stages of production</li><li>Designed for animation in mind</li><li>Push the boundaries of story art by drawing in a 3d environment</li><li>Powerful post FX and VFX tools like object motion tracking</li><li>Fully customisable UI and controles</li><li>Python API means every tool can be customized and scripted</li></ul><p>Blender is complex software and due to this some functions require different hardware specs but as a rule the higher the CPU speed and cores plus the more RAM you have the more you can do at any given time. With this said the minimum system requirements are as follows@</p><ul><li>Windows 8.1,10 and 11, macOS 10.13 and above and Linux supported</li><li>64-Bit quad core CPU with SSE2 support</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>Full HD display</li><li>Mouse, trackpad or pen+tablet</li><li>Graphics card with 2GB VRAM, OpenGL 4.3 support</li></ul><p>Blender receives regular updates and is supported by community scripts and content and is becoming a new go to tool for 3D artists in all industries and backgrounds making it a real contender when picking a workflow.</p><p><strong>From Desktop to Portable</strong></p><p>There are lots of options and this list is in no way stating what you may already use is not good enough, this is just what is being used in the industry and is more accessible to a starter or someone who works from home and doesn’t want to spend thousands upfront for their software.</p><p>That being said there is more than just the desktop workflow and some people lead busy lifestyles and are always on the move. This is where I would like to introduce the portable workflow. Due to the fact the Ipad Pro is considered a must have for portable creativity and with recent releases there has never been a better time to start i will be showing Ipad compatible apps.</p><h2 id="Forger-by-Maxon"><a href="#Forger-by-Maxon" class="headerlink" title="Forger by Maxon"></a>Forger by Maxon</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/forger-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="forger by maxon"                ></p><p>Forger is released as a standalone app or part of the Maxon one. Forger gives you all the tools needed to create sculptures and models on the go which you can be proud of. Designed by artists for artists the features are quite large considering this is running on an ipad and with the seamlessness of importing and exporting to and from software such as cinema 4D this can be worked into your workflow very easily. One feature of Forger that people like to talk about is the ability to use your ipad camera and view your model in the real world using augmented reality.</p><p>Some of the key features of Forger but not limited to are as follows:</p><ul><li>Multi-resolution mesh sculpting via catmull0clark mesh subdivisions.</li><li>Volume-based quad-dominant remeshing.</li><li>Sculpt in layers.</li><li>Sculpt with a mask with the ability to clear, invert, blur, grow and shrink your masks.</li><li>Ability to close holes in existing meshes</li><li>Simple auto-generation of mesh UVs.</li><li>Symmetrical sculpting based on axis of choice</li><li>Ability to reapply symmetry to topologically symmetrical meshes.</li></ul><p>Forger is very powerful and don’t let the fact it’s on an ipad make you think it’s inferior to the bigger desktop software as this is very capable of getting the results you are looking for. It just takes a bit of researching and a different learning curve. Due to the fact it is on an ipad the system requirements are easier to achieve, minimum system requirements are as follows</p><ul><li>IOS 15 or later</li><li>Ipad pro or current model ipad</li></ul><p>A note from the developers, the more complex the model being sculpted, the more RAM required. While there is no screen size requirement, as anticipated the bigger the better when it comes to sculpting workspace.</p><h2 id="Nomad-Sculpt"><a href="#Nomad-Sculpt" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Sculpt"></a>Nomad Sculpt</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/nomad-sculpt-software.jpg"                      alt="nomad sculpt software"                ></p><p>Nomad Sculpt is another contender offering powerful tools that artists can use to sculpt outstanding models for your animations. With a fixed price payment once you buy this you get regular updates and added features meaning you can buy with the confidence you will always have the best tools available. Nomad has a growing community of tutors giving guides and tutorials to get your desired results so no matter your experience Nomad is accessible to you. With the use of voxel remeshing and boolean you can experiment all you like and with the added history feature you can always undo and retrace your steps creating a non destructive workflow and piece of mind. Some of the key features of Nomad are as follows:</p><ul><li>Industry standard sculpting tools like clay, flatten, smooth, mask and cutting tools.</li><li>Stroke parameters can be customized with falloff, alphas and pencil pressure.</li><li>Vertex painting with color, roughness and metalness.</li><li>Work with layers for non destructive modeling.</li><li>Multiresolution sculpting for flexibility.</li><li>Voxel remeshing allows to quickly get uniform levels of detail.</li><li>Dynamic topology even with multiple layers.</li><li>PBR rendering by default with lighting and shadows and switchable matcaps</li><li>Post-processing , screen space reflection, depth of field, ambient occlusion and more</li><li>Customisable user interface</li></ul><p>Again due to being an app the system requirements are open to more users but unlike forger as of the writing of this Nomad is also available on Android giving people more options when choosing. System requirements are as follows:</p><ul><li>Iphone iOS 12.0 or later.</li><li>Ipad iPADOS 12.0 or later.</li><li>Ipod iOS 12.0 or later</li><li>Android 4.4 and up.</li></ul><h2 id="Procreate"><a href="#Procreate" class="headerlink" title="Procreate"></a>Procreate</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/procreate-3d-model.jpg"                      alt="procreate 3d model"                ></p><p>Procreate gets an honorable mention here due to the recent update that added the ability to paint in 3D directly onto your imported OBJ’s. This is a very cool feature as you can paint on different maps directly onto your model and get the exact results you wanted, the prerequisite for this is your OBJ needs to have UV’s already applied when you import into procreate and also this is limited to only three maps as of writing this, they have started they are going to advancing this feature in upcoming updates. Procreate also allows you to use augmented reality to view your models in the real world. Compatibility is as follows:</p><ul><li>Ipad iPadOS 14.4 or later.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can see there are many options and these are just a few or the ever expanding list out there but hopefully this has given you a good starting point with some of the leading industry tools to gain the results you wish. Depending on your setup and space you may lean towards desktop or laptop sculpting or you may be on the move a lot and find the portable option best meets your needs. Either way there is software out there for you to create that perfect sculpt and create the animation you have in your mind. Filmora is very powerful at editing your scenes together ready for uploading and with this guide you will soon be making scene after scene.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-exclusive-preview-general-knowledge-quiz-networks-of-2024/"><u>[New] Exclusive Preview  General Knowledge Quiz Networks of 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/infuse-vibrancy-in-presentations-via-audio-for-2024/"><u>Infuse Vibrancy in Presentations via Audio for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-gently-reducing-volume-level-in-fl-beats/"><u>In 2024, Gently Reducing Volume Level in FL Beats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/hue-mastery-interface-for-2024/"><u>Hue Mastery Interface for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-insights-into-attaining-stock-artwork/"><u>In 2024, Expert Insights Into Attaining Stock Artwork</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-extended-examination-gopro-slr4-edition-sliver/"><u>2024 Approved  Extended Examination  GoPro SLR4 Edition Sliver</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-influencing-cultures-through-memetic-expression/"><u>[Updated] Influencing Cultures Through Memetic Expression</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/innovative-image-editing-on-ios-best-tools-to-erase-objects-from-photos-for-2024/"><u>Innovative Image Editing on iOS  Best Tools to Erase Objects From Photos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-screen-mirroring-tecno-spark-go-2023-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Screen Mirroring Tecno Spark Go (2023) to PC? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/beyond-low-definition-the-ultimate-path-from-sdr-to-hdri-video-for-2024/"><u>Beyond Low Definition  The Ultimate Path From SDR to HDRI Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-zte-axon-40-lite-to-laptop-without-usb-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from ZTE Axon 40 Lite to Laptop Without USB | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-the-pro-gamers-screen-capture-strategy-for-xbox-one-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Pro Gamer's Screen Capture Strategy for Xbox One for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-15-screen-recorder-for-windows-11/"><u>2024 Approved  Top 15 Screen Recorder for Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/tutorial-to-change-lava-blaze-2-imei-without-root-a-comprehensive-guide-by-drfone-android/"><u>Tutorial to Change Lava Blaze 2 IMEI without Root A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unleashing-potential-innovative-strategies-in-tiktok-marketing/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unleashing Potential  Innovative Strategies in TikTok Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/transforming-your-speech-into-powerful-bass-with-filmora-filmmaking-for-2024/"><u>Transforming Your Speech Into Powerful Bass with Filmora Filmmaking for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevate-your-social-story-essential-tactics-for-facebook-profiles/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevate Your Social Story  Essential Tactics for Facebook Profiles</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

While there are many different ways to set up lighting, some methods are more effective than others.</p><p>Therefore, this article will give you a complete guide on how to set up your lighting to make your videos stand out.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Guide"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How-to Guide"></a>Part 1. How-to Guide</h2><p><strong><em>1) Preparation</em></strong></p><p>Before we get started, you may need to prepare some things to set up your lighting:</p><p><strong>1. Powerful LED Lights</strong></p><p>LED lights are a huge step up from traditional incandescent lighting because they generate much less heat and energy. Also, you can change the color temperature and use different lighting effects.</p><p><strong>2. Softbox</strong></p><p>Softbox can help you diffuse and spread the light on the subject.</p><p><strong>3. Fresnel lens</strong></p><p>A Fresnel lens is an optional attachment that can bounce the light off of the ceiling of your studio and diffuses the light to look soft.</p><p><strong><em>2) Steps</em></strong></p><p>For this tutorial, we will use the Three-Point Lighting technique:</p><h5 id="Step1-Set-the-Key-Light"><a href="#Step1-Set-the-Key-Light" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Set the Key Light"></a>Step1 Set the Key Light</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-1.jpg"                      alt="set the key light"                ></p><p>The key light is the main light that illuminates the subject. You can place it in the front and slightly to one side. For this key light, we use an LED called Aputure 300X as an example, and with a soft box called light Dome 2.</p><h5 id="Step2-Set-the-Fill-Light"><a href="#Step2-Set-the-Fill-Light" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Set the Fill Light"></a>Step2 Set the Fill Light</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-2.jpg"                      alt="set the fill light"                ></p><p>The fill light is used to fill in the shadows created by the key light. It is usually placed on the opposite side of the subject. For the fill light, we use an Aputure 300D with a fresnel lens attachment.</p><h5 id="Step3-Set-the-Backlight"><a href="#Step3-Set-the-Backlight" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Set the Backlight"></a>Step3 Set the Backlight</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-3.jpg"                      alt="set the backlight"                ></p><p>For this tutorial, we use Aperture 120d as the backlight and lift it up into the air with a c-stand so it can light the subject from above. It helps to separate the talent from the background and give the audience a full view of the set</p><h5 id="Step4-Use-Practical-Lights"><a href="#Step4-Use-Practical-Lights" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Use Practical Lights"></a>Step4 Use Practical Lights</h5><p>Practical lights appear on the camera to add some visual flair. It can be any light source that isn’t meant for lighting the subject. For example, we use a green lamp to help our background pop as it casts a nice orange light on the back wall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-4.jpg"                      alt="use practical lights"                ></p><p>Then, we also have a LED ring light that shines toward the camera. The light adds even more light to the frame and gives a slight backlight to the subject.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-5.jpg"                      alt="led ring light"                ></p><p>Finally, we have a few other small LED lights like this unicorn to put in the background. This lighting helps us to get even more visual flair out of our shots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-6.jpg"                      alt="other small led lights"                ></p><p>After setting up all the lighting above, you can take a look at the comparison below:</p><p><strong>Using Key Light only</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-7.jpg"                      alt="using key light only"                ></p><p><strong>Using Key Light + Fill + Backlight</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-8.jpg"                      alt="using key light + fill + backlight"                ></p><p><strong><em>3) Pro Tips: The light setting</em></strong></p><p>We usually set the lights around 50% brightness and a color temperature of 5600K.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-9.jpg"                      alt="the light setting"                ></p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, you learned something about lighting by taking a look at our setup.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Initiating-Film-Narratives"><a href="#Initiating-Film-Narratives" class="headerlink" title="Initiating Film Narratives"></a>Initiating Film Narratives</h2><p>A screenplay, also known as a script, is a piece of writing written by a screenwriter for a movie, television show, or video game. These screenplays may be original or modified from previously published material. They also describe the characters’ movements, actions, expressions, and dialogues. A teleplay is a screenplay written specifically for television.</p><p>A screenplay is a <strong>written text that serves as the foundation for film production</strong>. It usually includes not only the characters’ dialogue but also a shot-by-shot outline of the film’s action. This article will cover everything you need to know about screenplays.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-screenplay"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-screenplay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a screenplay?"></a>Part 1. What is a screenplay?</h2><p>A screenplay is a piece of writing that contains the dialogue for an entire film or television episode.</p><p>A screenplay can be based on original material, such as screenwriter ideas, or on pre-existing works, such as novels. The text is mostly dialogue, with descriptions of the environment, locations, scenery, costumes, and characters thrown in for good measure.</p><p>It can be used to ensure that everything in your story is consistent with what you’ve shot. It can also be used to assist with editing!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-1.jpg"                      alt="a screenplay"                ></p><p>A screenplay is a script for a film, television show, or play. It tells a story by using dialogue and action to show how the scenes are connected.</p><p>Are you considering writing a screenplay?</p><p>Are you wondering if it’s worth it?</p><p>This article will provide answers to your questions as well as resources to help you get started!</p><p>A screenplay is a story that describes what will be seen on film or television. They are written in a script format, which differs from novel writing.</p><p>The structure of a screenplay can differ depending on the type of film being produced and the amount of dialogue versus action.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Basic-standard-screenplay-formats"><a href="#Part-2-Basic-standard-screenplay-formats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Basic standard screenplay formats"></a>Part 2. Basic standard screenplay formats</h2><p>Screenplay format is <strong>a collection of 12 different elements</strong>, and writers should keep in mind that formatting their screenplay will benefit them in the long run.</p><p>The first tip is to begin with Fade In, which is located at the top left of the page. This informs your reader of their location and serves as a template for what should be written in your script.</p><p>If you want to be a screenwriter, you must be familiar with the proper screenplay format. It is not sufficient to simply write the dialogue and action for your script.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-2.jpg"                      alt="basic standard screenplay formats"                ></p><p>You must also include all the other elements so that no one is confused about what each one means. Many factors must be considered when writing good screenplays, such as formatting to make the screenplay readable to others. The script should be formatted in accordance with industry standards, with adequate margins, spaces between dialogues and action lines, and so on, so that readers can easily follow it.</p><p>Screenplays are a type of written or visual storytelling in which <strong>dialogue, action, and description are all included</strong>. They are typically used in the film industry to pitch a film or television show idea. They can be either fiction or nonfiction, depending on whether they use fictional stories or real-life facts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Templates-for-screenplay"><a href="#Part-3-Templates-for-screenplay" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Templates for screenplay"></a>Part 3. Templates for screenplay</h2><p>In simple words, a screenplay format template is a ready-made structure into which characters, movements, and story elements can be inserted to create a usable screenplay. It is essentially a layout with specific characteristics that suit a particular genre of screenwriting.</p><p>A psychological thriller script, for example, will have a different structure and pace than an action script. Both genres have storyboard templates that can be used for a variety of stories from each genre.</p><p>A thriller script template will structure character movement, staging, and dialogue delivery to look and move like an ideal thriller while preventing it from looking and moving like an action element.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-3.jpg"                      alt="templates for screenplay"                ></p><p>We currently have screenplay format templates for nearly every theatrical and film genre, including drama, comedy, action, thriller, autobiography, and others. Each of these templates has a unique structure, but the best ones share some characteristics.</p><h3 id="1-Characteristics-of-the-Ideal-Screenplay-Format-Template"><a href="#1-Characteristics-of-the-Ideal-Screenplay-Format-Template" class="headerlink" title="1. Characteristics of the Ideal Screenplay Format Template"></a>1. Characteristics of the Ideal Screenplay Format Template</h3><p>Regardless of the screenplay genre, each screenplay template has some characteristics that set it apart from the rest. However, all ideal scenarios have the following characteristics in common:</p><ul><li>Complex layout</li><li>Current features</li><li>Configurability</li><li>Creative space</li></ul><p>Let’s look at each of the characteristics individually.</p><h3 id="2-Comprehensive-Layout"><a href="#2-Comprehensive-Layout" class="headerlink" title="2. Comprehensive Layout"></a>2. Comprehensive Layout</h3><p>If you look at the screenplays for some of the greatest movies ever made, you’ll find that they all contain a complete and detailed story arc with textbook variations in pacing and dialogue as the story progresses.</p><p>Yes, almost all screenplays have some holes that may have been overlooked in the writing, but as a structure, they will include all the essential aspects of the story they are telling.</p><p>That said, a great screenplay format template:</p><ul><li>Format by genre</li><li>Have enough space for brainstorming and subject research</li><li>Layout of main acts, chapters, and scenes</li><li>Leave room for editing characters and settings (left margin and right margin variations)</li><li>Easy to use for beginners</li></ul><p>Aside from some niche genres like anthology and neo-bizarro, every ideal screenplay format template has some combination of these qualities.</p><h3 id="3-Contemporary-Features"><a href="#3-Contemporary-Features" class="headerlink" title="3. Contemporary Features"></a>3. Contemporary Features</h3><p>Scenarios have had a similar structure since the beginning of the last century.</p><p>The same title page, with the same standard Courier font, text indentation, scene title&#x2F;slug line and subtitle prefixes (INT-EXT), action line layout, etc. All this has remained unchanged over the years.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-4.jpg"                      alt="contemporary features"                ></p><p>However, with the advent of app-based screenwriting software, we have plenty of contemporary features such as automatic page numbers, time of day, parentheses, and pop-ups with specific character names.</p><p>Even the general rule of thumb “one-page equals one minute of screen time” doesn’t apply to all scripts today.</p><p>While it’s not necessary to have a fully automated script layout interface, any task that can be automated gives the writer more time for important tasks like contributing to off-screen production, recording voice-overs, etc.</p><p>Plus, since most writers today prefer a smartphone to a traditional typewriter, it pays to have a screenplay editor in the palm of your hand.</p><h3 id="4-Configurability"><a href="#4-Configurability" class="headerlink" title="4. Configurability"></a>4. Configurability</h3><p>Rigid script formatting risks making your story look and sound like all the stories that have used it in the past.</p><p>The same events, the same character archetypes, the same moves and submissions, and the same build-ups can quickly become boring.</p><p>The best storyboard templates have a structure that is created with the genre of the story in mind but gives the writer room to play around with their characters, setting, etc.</p><p>For example, when I’m writing a character who’s learning to write a book, I’d like to show her picking up references from nature and various other creative genres and coming back to change her style—not just research from the works of other writers.</p><p>Taking an unconventional approach to character development can seem counterproductive and time-consuming. However, a good script draft will allow the writer to do this without making the script unbalanced.</p><h3 id="5-Creative-Space"><a href="#5-Creative-Space" class="headerlink" title="5. Creative Space"></a>5. Creative Space</h3><p>Stiffness is a very common factor in most traditional screenplay formats.</p><p>A certain rigidity is good because it keeps the story structured and prevents writers from focusing too deeply on one aspect and neglecting the rest.</p><p>However, script templates should not be too restrictive in terms of creative freedom for the writer.</p><p>For example, an ideal screenwriting template should allow one character out of several to experience a different phase of character development than the others at any point in the plot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-5.jpg"                      alt="creative space"                ></p><p>This prevents all characters from looking and sounding like they were cast from a similar mold and have no unique development of their own.</p><p>In addition, the best templates should allow screenwriters to adjust their plot development to write for feature films as well as series.</p><p>Common fictional tropes have already been adopted by thousands of screenwriters around the world. The job of a perfect template is to give you enough creative space to create a unique story from a traditional genre.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Make-your-own-screenplay-by-using-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-Make-your-own-screenplay-by-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

However, using this method proved expensive and meant that some companies were missing out on the lucrative video streaming market.</p><p>As such, the Alliance for Open Media was formed in 2015 to develop an open-source, royalty-free video codec to outperform all previous versions.

For example, you can indicate a throwback photo by making it black and white.</li><li>Additionally, color grading photoshop is an excellent way to elicit different moods. For example, a color scheme that features bright yellows, greens, or blues can indicate different excitement levels.</li><li>Furthermore, you use color correction and color grading to indicate the importance of some scene sections. For example, news briefs are usually brighter than the rest of the shot, especially when displaying important messages, such as breaking news.</li><li>Finally, you do photoshop cinematic color grading to ensure consistency in your photos.

But before you start posting about your giveaway, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. Here are some tips for running a successful Facebook giveaway.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Choose-a-giveaway-prize-that-is-relevant-to-your-target-audience"><a href="#Part-1-Choose-a-giveaway-prize-that-is-relevant-to-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Choose a giveaway prize that is relevant to your target audience</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-giveaway-prize-for-facebook.jpg"                      alt="choose giveaway prize for facebook"                ></p><p>When it comes to choosing a giveaway prize, relevant is always the best way to go. First, consider your target audience. What would they be interested in? A coffee mug with your company logo may be great for some, but if you’re targeting outdoorsy types, they might prefer a hiking hat or water bottle.</p><p>Really think about what your target audience would find useful or fun, and choose a prize accordingly. It’ll make them more likely to enter the giveaway, and more likely to remember your brand down the line. Plus, it’ll show that you’re tuned into their interests - always a plus in the eyes of potential customers. So, when you’re planning your next giveaway, keep relevance front and center, and you’ll be sure to choose a winner.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-sure-the-giveaway-is-compliant-with-Facebook’s-rules"><a href="#Part-2-Make-sure-the-giveaway-is-compliant-with-Facebook’s-rules" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Otherwise, your giveaway could be shut down and you could be at risk of being banned from the platform. Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>You must use a third-party app to host your giveaway. Facebook does not allow giveaways to be hosted directly on its platform.</li><li>Your giveaway must have clearly defined rules. For example, you will need to specify how winners will be chosen and what the prize is.</li><li>You are responsible for ensuring that your giveaway is fair and legal. This means making sure that there is no purchase necessary to enter and that the prize is not illegal or restricted in any way.</li><li>Make sure you promote your giveaway in a way that complies with Facebook’s advertising policies.

This will help to create a sense of urgency and encourage people to action. It’s also important to be clear about what the deadline is.</p><p>For example, if you’re giving away a prize every day, make sure to specify that entrants must submit their entry by 11:59 PM on the day of the drawing. Finally, don’t forget to promote the deadline! Make sure that your social media posts and emails include information about when the giveaway ends.</p><p>By taking these simple steps, you can make sure that your giveaway runs smoothly and meets your goals.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Choose-a-winner-randomly-from-among-all-entrants"><a href="#Part-5-Choose-a-winner-randomly-from-among-all-entrants" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Use Photoshop"></a>2. Use Photoshop</h2><p>Want to learn how to create a meme with Photoshop? This manual is meant to assist. Since the invention of the internet, memes have increased to disseminate complex information in brief, digestible chunks. It is a low-cost, high-impact image that may be quickly produced and destroyed. Many meme creators are available, including one in Photoshop, but using Photoshop itself will give you much more power.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-meme-with-ps.jpg"                      alt="make meme with ps"                ></p><p>Here’s how to create memes on your computer using only Photoshop CC. Choose a photo and <strong>make it a meme</strong> with these steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Create document:</strong> Before starting your Photoshop, check the social platform for desired dimensions and format. For this, you can start with a size of 1080px X1080px. It is a standard image used for Instagram. You can even use Artboards for creating templates, and that’s what you must make sure that they are made in the new document.</li><li><strong>Select image:</strong> The meme’s popularity is based chiefly on image strength, which usually relies on humor to draw attention. You can add the image to photoshop in several ways. You can open the picture in your application, select, copy and paste it on the canvas. You can find even important pictures directly to the file or use the drag and drop option. You can select <strong>the face you make a meme</strong> with**.**</li><li><strong>Make your background:</strong> No meme is completed without the proper background. The background is crucial to make the content attractive. You will have to create new layers with the shortcut “Cmd+Shift+N” and then drag this to the bottom layer, go to the Edit, and click on Fill. You can see numerous options in the menu, selecting the pattern and then choosing a custom pattern.</li><li><strong>Add Text:</strong> In the end, a meme’s appearance serves as a vehicle for its message. The writing should be boldly extensive and assertive next to the image, compromising style for effect. To create a box across the canvas, use the Type tool. Aim for a structure with one significant remark and a lesser message below by keeping the wording extensive and straightforward.</li></ul><h2 id="3-Use-Canva"><a href="#3-Use-Canva" class="headerlink" title="3.

Use Photoshop"></a>2. Use Photoshop</h2><p>Want to learn how to create a meme with Photoshop? This manual is meant to assist. Since the invention of the internet, memes have increased to disseminate complex information in brief, digestible chunks. It is a low-cost, high-impact image that may be quickly produced and destroyed. Many meme creators are available, including one in Photoshop, but using Photoshop itself will give you much more power.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-meme-with-ps.jpg"                      alt="make meme with ps"                ></p><p>Here’s how to create memes on your computer using only Photoshop CC. Choose a photo and <strong>make it a meme</strong> with these steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Create document:</strong> Before starting your Photoshop, check the social platform for desired dimensions and format. For this, you can start with a size of 1080px X1080px. It is a standard image used for Instagram. You can even use Artboards for creating templates, and that’s what you must make sure that they are made in the new document.</li><li><strong>Select image:</strong> The meme’s popularity is based chiefly on image strength, which usually relies on humor to draw attention. You can add the image to photoshop in several ways. You can open the picture in your application, select, copy and paste it on the canvas. You can find even important pictures directly to the file or use the drag and drop option. You can select <strong>the face you make a meme</strong> with**.**</li><li><strong>Make your background:</strong> No meme is completed without the proper background. The background is crucial to make the content attractive. You will have to create new layers with the shortcut “Cmd+Shift+N” and then drag this to the bottom layer, go to the Edit, and click on Fill. You can see numerous options in the menu, selecting the pattern and then choosing a custom pattern.</li><li><strong>Add Text:</strong> In the end, a meme’s appearance serves as a vehicle for its message. The writing should be boldly extensive and assertive next to the image, compromising style for effect. To create a box across the canvas, use the Type tool. Aim for a structure with one significant remark and a lesser message below by keeping the wording extensive and straightforward.</li></ul><h2 id="3-Use-Canva-1"><a href="#3-Use-Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

This new release has a better design, additional flight options and a special system to avoid objects should they get in the way of your drones flight path.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 11 Best DJI Phantom 4 Accessories to Buy &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dji-phandom-4.jpg"                      alt="dji phantom 4"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CFXQZD0/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01CFXQZD0&linkId=edcac98fb2e38b9359b8299650e268df" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Complete-Review-for-DJI-Phantom-4"><a href="#Complete-Review-for-DJI-Phantom-4" class="headerlink" title="Complete Review for DJI Phantom 4"></a>Complete Review for DJI Phantom 4</h2><h4 id="Pros-of-DJI-Phantom-4"><a href="#Pros-of-DJI-Phantom-4" class="headerlink" title="Pros of DJI Phantom 4"></a><strong>Pros of DJI Phantom 4</strong></h4><ul><li>Obstacle sensing system</li><li>Two cameras for distance recognition</li><li>Artificial intelligence</li><li>Connects to GPS and GLONASS</li><li>New gimbal for sturdier videos and ease of maneuvering</li><li>Lighter frame</li><li>30 fps videos and 120 fps capabilities</li><li>Improved lens</li><li>Travels up to 45 mph</li><li>Easy to fly</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-of-DJI-Phantom-4"><a href="#Cons-of-DJI-Phantom-4" class="headerlink" title="Cons of DJI Phantom 4"></a><strong>Cons of DJI Phantom 4</strong></h4><ul><li>Set up time</li><li>Missing set up guidelines making it harder for novice operators</li><li>Small branch recognition</li><li>Batter lasts 28 minutes up to 5km</li><li>$169 for extra battery power</li></ul><h4 id="Feature-and-specs"><a href="#Feature-and-specs" class="headerlink" title="Feature and specs"></a>Feature and specs</h4><ul><li>Weight : (Battery &amp; Propellers Included) 1388 g</li><li>Max Ascent Speed: S-mode: 6 m&#x2F;s - P-mode: 5 m&#x2F;s</li><li>Max Flight Time : 30 minutes approximately</li><li>Obstacle Sensory Range: 0.6 - 23 feet (0.2 - 7 m)</li><li>Vision System: Forward Vision System, Backward Vision System, Downward Vision System</li><li>Battery Type: LiPo 4S</li><li>Max Video Bitrate 100 Mbps</li><li>Supported File Systems :FAT32 (≤32 GB); exFAT (&gt;32 GB)</li><li>Photo: JPEG, DNG (RAW), JPEG + DNG</li><li>Video: MP4&#x2F;MOV (AVC&#x2F;; &#x2F;)</li><li>Supported SD Cards: Micro SD</li><li>Max Capacity: 128GB</li><li>Write speed ≥15MB&#x2F;s, Class 10 or UHS-1 rating required</li></ul><h4 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dji-phantom-4-design.jpg"                      alt="dji phantom 4 review"                ></p><p> The Phantom 4 is similar to the previous version in terms of looks. It is white in color and plastic with sturdy legs to rest on. Two sensors are located on the front and back of the drone and more underneath and to the sides. The camera begins to record on takeoff allowing the drone to find a homing position when ready to return home. The camera hangs below the drone with gimbals that keep it sturdy whatever conditions it is flown in. The arms each have lights so that you can find it easily when in flight.</p><h4 id="Battery-life"><a href="#Battery-life" class="headerlink" title="Battery life"></a>Battery life</h4><p> Underneath the shell of the Phantom 4 is the battery which is high density at 5,870Ah. This allows it to be flown for up to half an hour.</p><h4 id="Sensor-obstacle-avoidance-sensors"><a href="#Sensor-obstacle-avoidance-sensors" class="headerlink" title="Sensor - obstacle avoidance sensors"></a>Sensor - obstacle avoidance sensors</h4><p> The Phantom 4 has a high performance system to avoid objects. The front, back and sides all have sensors which are able to detect potential hazards from around 98 feet with or not they are in front of the drone or behind it. An example of where this would be useful is flying it through a doorway indoors as it is able to go through the doorway without being in danger of crashing into the door frame. Even at 31 miles an hour the avoidance system still works. They do switch off however when you switch to sports mode with increased speed capabilities of 40 miles an hour.</p><h4 id="Flight-performance"><a href="#Flight-performance" class="headerlink" title="Flight performance"></a>Flight performance</h4><p> One of the great features enjoyed by Phantom 4 owners is ‘draw’. This allows users to draw a line on their screen for their drone to follow at the same altitude. You can keep the camera in a forward position or leave it free to move such as in follow mode. The sensors in flight not only detect people in the way but also other objects including cars, bikes and trees. The camera locks to its subject continually while the drone fly’s as set out by the user. The TapFly function allows you to get the drone to go in the direction of where you tapped, by using the TapFly backwards you can make it fly in the opposite direction all while the avoidance system works (except in sports mode). Return to home allows you to get the drone to return to its setting off point easily as it records the route and even chooses the one that is best for the conditions it is being flown in to avoid damage.</p><h4 id="Control-range"><a href="#Control-range" class="headerlink" title="Control range"></a>Control range</h4><p> The Phantom 4 plus comes with a built in screen which has a display screen of 5.5 inches and 1080p. The remote is able to connect to the drone from up to 4.3 miles away and can stream full HD to the display screen. The remote battery can last for up to 5 hours before it needs to be charged.</p><h4 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dji-phantom-4-camera.jpg"                      alt="dji phantom 4 review"                ></p><p> The Phantom 4 has been upgraded to include a 20 megapixel sensor which has 12 dynamic range stops which allows for more detailed shots even in intense light. This improves the performance from its predecessor significantly. The mechanical shutter stops the distortion and makes for smoother footage. The 4K video at 60 fps capabilities increase the quality overall giving users better results.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> The Phantom 4 literally does everything you could need it to. It flies well in all kinds of conditions, reaches great speeds to capture sports play and even avoids objects that would otherwise give users and their drones quite an unhappy ending. As the Phantom 4 is so easy to fly it means that users can concentrate on their footage. With the follow me mode users can literally go hands free and still get great results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-hasty-handbook-building-picture-groups-on-mac/"><u>[New] Hasty Handbook  Building Picture Groups on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-gigglegraphy-laughter-in-a-frame/"><u>2024 Approved  GiggleGraphy  Laughter in a Frame</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/exclusive-listing-top-15-platforms-for-gopro-optimal-use-for-2024/"><u>Exclusive Listing  Top 15 Platforms for GoPro Optimal Use for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovative-approaches-to-color-correction-with-gopro-studio/"><u>In 2024, Innovative Approaches to Color Correction with GoPro Studio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-exploring-the-power-of-focused-image-blurring/"><u>In 2024, Exploring the Power of Focused Image Blurring</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-filmmakers-choice-converting-avi-files-to-gif-via-filmora-software-windowsmac/"><u>[Updated] Filmmaker's Choice  Converting AVI Files to GIF via Filmora Software (Windows/Mac)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-how-to-blur-a-picture-on-iphone-4-ways/"><u>[New] How to Blur a Picture on iPhone [4 Ways]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-comparative-review-of-top-6-chrome-devices-offering-advanced-voice-manipulation-features-filmmagicworkshop/"><u>In 2024, A Comparative Review of Top 6 Chrome Devices Offering Advanced Voice Manipulation Features - FilmMagicWorkshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/solved-warning-camera-failed-on-motorola-moto-g13-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Solved Warning Camera Failed on Motorola Moto G13 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-pc-screen-to-vivo-y78t-phones-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Mirror PC Screen to Vivo Y78t Phones? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-common-youtube-shorts-when-thumbnails-disappear-without-notice-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Common YouTube Shorts  When Thumbnails Disappear Without Notice for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-free-online-photo-editors-to-blur-unwanted-backgrounds-for-2024/"><u>New Free Online Photo Editors to Blur Unwanted Backgrounds for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/easily-unlock-your-oppo-a38-device-sim-by-drfone-android/"><u>Easily Unlock Your Oppo A38 Device SIM</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-snap-ad-creation-essential-tips-for-impactful-promotion/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering Snap Ad Creation  Essential Tips for Impactful Promotion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-capturing-quality-video-on-macbook/"><u>[New] Capturing Quality Video on MacBook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-pioneering-platform-potential-the-10-most-effective-igtv-strategies-for-brands/"><u>In 2024, Pioneering Platform Potential  The 10 Most Effective IGTV Strategies for Brands</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

AR Stands for augmented reality - a technology that combines the real world and digital content. You can use it to make fun images and videos. But how do you use this feature? And are there options for people without a Google Pixel phone?</p><p>In this article, we will take a look at this feature. Also, we will show you a great alternative that lets you experience the same but using other devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-ar-stickers-its-alternative.gif"                      alt="google ar stickers and its alternative"                ></p><h2 id="What-Is-Google-AR-Sticker"><a href="#What-Is-Google-AR-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="What Is Google AR Sticker?"></a>What Is Google AR Sticker?</h2><p>Think of stickers that you can put on images or videos. However, these stickers are in 3D. Furthermore, they look like they are actually in the environment or they are a part of your body. However, you can only see them through a camera lens.</p><p>You can look at Pokemon Go to understand it better. The game allows you to “place” your Pokemon in the real world and take photos of them. Google AR stickers are like that, except the stickers are not strictly only Pokemon. There are letters, food, Stranger Things characters, and more!</p><h2 id="History-of-Google-AR-Sticker"><a href="#History-of-Google-AR-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="History of Google AR Sticker"></a>History of Google AR Sticker</h2><p>Back in 2017, virtual reality and augmented reality received an increase in interest. While these technologies weren’t really new, it was at this time that they became common. Apps like Snapchat included AR stickers that allowed users to take photos and videos with their favorite fictional characters and such. Google hopped on the trend by incorporating AR stickers into its smartphone, Pixel 2.</p><p>The thing is that it did not last long. Ever since Google launched its Pixel 4a in 2020, they no longer provided AR stickers. The camera of the new devices is not compatible with AR stickers, Playground, and Playmoji. And that’s the end of Google AR Stickers.</p><p>Owners of older Pixel models should not worry since the devices’ hardware isn’t changed. Thus, they will continue to support Playground, the app needed to use Google AR Stickers.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Google-Playground-AR-Stickers-on-Pixel-4-and-Earlier"><a href="#How-To-Use-Google-Playground-AR-Stickers-on-Pixel-4-and-Earlier" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Google Playground AR Stickers on Pixel 4 and Earlier"></a>How To Use Google Playground AR Stickers on Pixel 4 and Earlier</h2><p>As mentioned above, older Pixel models still have Google Playground support. These devices are Pixel 4 and earlier. Meanwhile, Playmojis (3D AR Stickers) are available only for Pixel 3, 3a, and 4.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step tutorial on how to use this feature:</p><p>Step1 Ensure you have Android 8.1 (Oreo) installed on your Pixel. Also, ensure the Google Camera app is updated.</p><p>Step2 Launch the Google Camera app.</p><p>Step3 Tap **”**More” &gt; “Playground.”</p><p>Step4 Select “Stickers” &gt; “Playmoji” or “Stickers.”</p><p>Step5 Tap the AR Sticker or Playmoji that you want to use.</p><p>Step6 Touch and hold, and drag the AR sticker where you want it to be on the photo or video. Adjust the sticker as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-ar-stickers-6.jpg"                      alt="dragging star wars sticker to camera screen"                ></p><p>Step7 Tap “Capture” to take a photo.

It’s understandable since “augmented reality” sounds very advanced and complex. Here are some FAQs about it to make you more informed about the subject.</p><p><strong>Q1. What Are AR Stickers?</strong></p><p>AR stickers are augmented reality image effects you can add to improve photos or videos. They can be static images or animations. Some examples are eyeglasses, bunny headbands, hats, beards, or even animals or characters.</p><p>The application that offers it maps your face or the environment in the video and tracks movements. With that, they make it seem like the AR sticker is real instead of a virtual object.</p><p>Let’s suppose you added AR eyeglasses to the video you are recording. When you move, the eyeglasses will follow your eyes instead of staying where they originally were.</p><p><strong>Q2. Can You Use AR Without an App?</strong></p><p>Perhaps you don’t want to install custom AR apps. That’s not new. According to some studies, engagement drops by 50% when users need to download. So, some developers chose the WebAR path instead.</p><p>WebAR uses web technologies to let users experience augmented reality. All you need is a phone or any device with a camera and a web browser. Since most modern browsers and operating systems already support AR, WebAR makes the experience so accessible.</p><p><strong>Q3. Are AR Apps Safe?</strong></p><p>AR Apps can be dangerous, but not all of them are. Keep in mind that AR apps can see what you are doing in real-time. If that information falls into the wrong hands, you may end up in trouble.</p><p>Vendors can also add malware or other things to the apps. So it’s necessary that you always stay vigilant.
