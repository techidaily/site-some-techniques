The original version of the drone was incredibly fun to fly but the Bebop 2 makes new improvements in performance, battery life and video quality. Although the controls for the Bebop are not as precise as some other types of drones on the market like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DJI Phantom 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the performance and the attractive video that this drone can capture make it a true performance leader in the market.</p><p> The Parrot Bebop is a drone that was in development for over two years since the initial release of the original drone. It comes with a very reasonable price point at under $600 and it is capable of completing over 25 min of autonomous flight before going back to base. The specs on this drone make it a leader in amateur <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >filmmaking, photographs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and more. This is a drone that’s well-suited for use both indoors and outdoors and they commonly go on sale allowing many people to start up their drone hobby without having to invest thousands of dollars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2.jpg"                      alt="parrot bebop 2"                ></p><h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Parrot-Bebop-2"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Parrot-Bebop-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Parrot Bebop 2"></a>Pros and Cons of Parrot Bebop 2</h2><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Tt’s extremely lightweight design</li><li>The cameras respectable with a fisheye lens capable of capturing 30 frames per second at 1080 P</li><li>The device can also capture 14 megapixel shots with fairly stable movement</li><li>The battery life has more than doubled allowing up to 25 min of flight time</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Camera functions have not been improved greatly from the previous version</li><li>Image distortions</li><li>The control sticks can also sometimes be quick to go unresponsive long before the parrot reaches its extended service range</li></ul><h2 id="Complete-review-for-Parrot-Bebop-2"><a href="#Complete-review-for-Parrot-Bebop-2" class="headerlink" title="Complete review for Parrot Bebop 2"></a>Complete review for Parrot Bebop 2</h2><h4 id="1-Features-and-specs"><a href="#1-Features-and-specs" class="headerlink" title="1.  Features and specs"></a>1.  Features and specs</h4><p> The main features for this device are it’s improved stable movement with a three axis accelerometer and ultrasound sensor. These improved sensors and waypoint controls make the process of actually flying one of these drones very easy. The motor is also known for its speed and its capable of reaching a height of 100 m in just 18 seconds after takeoff. This is a very fast and highflying drone. The improved battery life of up to 25 min. with a 2700 mA battery is a considerable improvement for this drone as well. The two nicest features which are available for new drone flyers are the return home feature where you can set a waypoint for the drone to land after it runs out of battery as well as the free flight three application. The free flight application is one of the easiest ways that you can control your drone with the help of a tablet or smartphone and set waypoints for capturing the shots you want.</p><h4 id="2-Design"><a href="#2-Design" class="headerlink" title="2.  Design"></a>2.  Design</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2-design.png"                      alt="parrot bebop 2 design"                ></p><p> The design of this drone has definitely been improved for performance as well as resiliency. The previous version of the parrot was fairly simple to break but this newest version is much stronger and easier to control especially with the help of the application. This is a drone that has definitely been designed with beginner users in mind. The only design flaw with this drone is that the camera was not updated in any way. Parrot makes the process of ordering extra parts extremely simple through their online store and you can keep this drone running over an extended amount of time quite easily.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-Life"><a href="#3-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.  Battery Life"></a>3.  Battery Life</h4><p> The battery life on this drone is excellent for the type of video that shoots as well as the controls offered on the device. Previous versions of the parrot could only fly for 11 min. but this drone can fly uninterrupted for 25 minutes or less. The improved battery life on this drone is comparable with others in the price point but not many of them feature the same quality of image.</p><h4 id="4-Flight-performance"><a href="#4-Flight-performance" class="headerlink" title="4.  Flight performance"></a>4.  Flight performance</h4><p> This is a high-performing drone that has great stability controls and an application that can ease the process of flight. The return home feature helps to protect the drone in the event of a battery problem or when the user is finished filming. As landing these drones can be some of the most difficult aspects of operation, flight performance with a return home feature is one of the easiest ways to protect it.</p><h4 id="5-Control-Range"><a href="#5-Control-Range" class="headerlink" title="5.  Control Range"></a>5.  Control Range</h4><p> Parrot does have an accessory to extend the control range of the Bebop 2 to 2 km. The drone out of the box has a range of 300 m to work with when using the controls. If you plan on using the drone regularly, the extra control range can be very helpful.</p><h4 id="6-Camera"><a href="#6-Camera" class="headerlink" title="6.  Camera"></a>6.  Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2-camera.jpg"                      alt="parrot bebop 2 camera"                ></p><p> The 14 megapixel fisheye lens camera is backed up by 8 GB of onboard storage. The cameras capable of capturing 1080 P video at 30 frames per second and it does produce a fairly good quality image. Some users have made light complaints about lens flare and a few other distortion qualities but overall, it’s difficult to find a drone and camera built in combo that can produce an image this good, for the same price.</p><h4 id="7-The-free-flight-app"><a href="#7-The-free-flight-app" class="headerlink" title="7.  The free flight app"></a>7.  The free flight app</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-free-app.gif"                      alt="parrot bebop 2 free app"                ></p><p> The free flight app is a huge asset to this drone. Not only can you use controls from your smart phone or tablet to see from the drone, but you can also set waypoints using the tablet using GPS functions and rely on the autonomous flight capabilities as well as the return home functions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/illuminating-imagery-pro-level-tips-for-spectacular-photos-for-2024/"><u>Illuminating Imagery  Pro-Level Tips for Spectacular Photos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-grids-for-greatness-photographs-next-step-up/"><u>[New] Grids for Greatness  Photographs' Next Step Up</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/grappling-giants-twitch-triumph-or-hitbox-heroics-for-2024/"><u>Grappling Giants  Twitch Triumph or Hitbox Heroics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-filmoras-top-10-for-seamless-image-transitions/"><u>[Updated] Filmora's Top 10 for Seamless Image Transitions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-blogging-to-broadcasting-scaling-up-your-youtube-presence/"><u>2024 Approved  From Blogging to Broadcasting  Scaling Up Your YouTube Presence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-use-windows-media-player-to-rip-and-burn-cd/"><u>[Updated] How to Use Windows Media Player to Rip and Burn Cd</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-holistic-editing-experience-panoramashift-evolution/"><u>[Updated] Holistic Editing Experience  PanoramaShift Evolution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-gopro-vlogging-101-techniques-for-a-polished-look/"><u>[Updated] GoPro Vlogging 101  Techniques for a Polished Look</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-high-performance-low-price-excellent-asmr-mics/"><u>2024 Approved  High Performance, Low Price  Excellent ASMR Mics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-heaviest-heroes-in-the-air-drone-power-list/"><u>[New] Heaviest Heroes in the Air  Drone Power List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unlock-the-speed-dial-tips-and-tricks-to-fast-forward-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlock the Speed Dial  Tips and Tricks to Fast Forward on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pixel-perfection-in-image-integration/"><u>2024 Approved  Pixel Perfection in Image Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-post-with-a-podcast-highlight-moment/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Post with a Podcast Highlight Moment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-bringing-favorite-manga-characters-to-life-in-tiktok/"><u>[New] Bringing Favorite Manga Characters to Life in TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-all-you-need-to-know-about-adding-apple-music-to-video-for-2024/"><u>[New] All You Need to Know About Adding Apple Music to Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-16-best-free-avi-video-rotators-windows-mac-android-iphone-and-online/"><u>Updated In 2024, Top 16 Best Free AVI Video Rotators Windows, MAC, Android, iPhone, and Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-samsung-galaxy-f14-5g-adb-format-tool-for-pc-vs-other-unlocking-tools-which-one-is-the-best-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Samsung Galaxy F14 5G ADB Format Tool for PC vs. Other Unlocking Tools Which One is the Best?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-forgotten-pin-of-your-oppo-find-n3-flip-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Remove Forgotten PIN Of Your Oppo Find N3 Flip</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-get-the-meltan-box-pokemon-go-for-motorola-moto-g04-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Ultimate guide to get the meltan box pokemon go For Motorola Moto G04 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-parroting-perfection-dissecting-bebops-latest-flight-feature/"><u>[Updated] Parroting Perfection  Dissecting Bebop's Latest Flight Feature</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It takes two seconds to create a GIPHY account if you don’t already have one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/download-giphy-app.jpg"                      alt="download giphy app"                ></p><p>Step2 To upload a video to GIPHY, click Upload. To add a video from your computer or mobile device, choose ‘Choose File’ as there is an option to do so</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/upload-video-to-giphy.jpg"                      alt="upload video to giphy"                ></p><p>Step3 If you wish to upload a video from a URL, you may do so.

Alternative Way to Make Meme Video"></a>Part 2. Alternative Way to Make Meme Video</h2><p>Giphy should be a desirable option for content and advertising partners due to the search engine and the thorough social integration of its content. The language of the internet is memes. Despite the fact that some of them may be somewhat strange. There is a text option in every specialized video editing program, but <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides something more eye-catching for you! You may create inspiring graphics with quotes using the hundreds of other stock images that Filmora provides, as well as share personal stories, talk about current events, and more. You may also make use of your own images.</p><p>There are innumerable varieties of memes, but the ones that most people are familiar with are just pictures with a few lines of text. A video may easily have text added to it. Given that having certain video editing skills boosts the hilarity of your memes, you may employ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> professional video editing options.

Simply choose Import, then carry out the following:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles-win-1.png"                      alt="import files to filmora"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Include-Music-and-Subtitles"><a href="#Step3-Include-Music-and-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Include Music and Subtitles"></a>Step3 Include Music and Subtitles</h5><p>The video file must then be included in the timeline.

Enter the text, then alter the caption’s typeface, color, and size.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles-win-2.png"                      alt="include music and subtitles"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Edit-the-Meme"><a href="#Step4-Edit-the-Meme" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Edit the Meme"></a>Step4 Edit the Meme</h5><p>If you want to add additional text to your meme, use the features-list menu bar.

Save your final meme and upload it right away to your email, Facebook, Twitter, etc. to share it with coworkers or friends.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Additionally, Giphy offers a Giphy Cam software that enables users to create custom GIFs from video footage captured with their smartphone cameras.

However, for many users, this is a significant concern.</p><p>After all, faster-paced songs are more engaging and high-energy, invoking feelings of fun and excitement in people. This is one of the reasons why the sped-up songs on videos posted on social media platforms like TikTok are so catchy and shareable.</p><p>If you want a fast-paced song version but not necessarily a pre-made remix with extra effects, manually speeding it up should help**.**</p><p>If that is a concern for you, worry not. This post will detail the best solutions and software to <strong>speed up music on Spotify</strong> using its rich library of songs, with steps. Let’s continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/a-comprehensive-analysis-on-how-to-speed-up-audio-files-on-spotify-safely-1.jpg"                      alt="image of spotify app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-How-to-Speed-Up-Songs-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-I-How-to-Speed-Up-Songs-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part I. How to Speed Up Songs on Spotify?"></a>Part I. How to Speed Up Songs on Spotify?</h2><p>Firstly, consider if the process of <strong>changing a song’s speed on Spotify</strong> is directly applicable to the platform. The answer to that is no. As of the time of this writing, Spotify or any of the well-known online audio streaming sites still need to offer the music playback speed adjustment feature. This applies to both web and mobile versions while streaming songs.</p><p>While there is no direct function for adjusting Spotify songs or even podcasts’ playback speed, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-playback-speed-ac/cgbihpjbhpdfbdckcabcniojdhcgblhd" >Spotify Playback Speed Access <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of Spotify Web Player. This is a Google Chrome extension that allows users the ability to <strong>speed up Spotify songs</strong>, mainly on the web app version.</p><p>However, this extension was last updated in October 2019. So, while using it, you might notice some issues.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Change-Playback-Speed-on-Spotify-Web-Player"><a href="#Method-1-Change-Playback-Speed-on-Spotify-Web-Player" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Change Playback Speed on Spotify Web Player"></a>Method 1: Change Playback Speed on Spotify Web Player</h3><p>The following are the main steps you should follow to <strong>Spotify speed up music via the Spotify Web Player:</strong></p><p>Step1: Go to Google Chrome Web Store and search for the Spotify Playback Speed Access extension.</p><p>Step2: Tap the “Add to Chrome” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/a-comprehensive-analysis-on-how-to-speed-up-audio-files-on-spotify-safely-2.jpg"                      alt="tap the add to chrome button"                ></p><p>Step3: Access the Spotify web player on your device and access the Spotify account by logging in.</p><p>Step4: Tap on the triangle icon and increase&#x2F;decrease the playback speed of the songs while listening.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/a-comprehensive-analysis-on-how-to-speed-up-audio-files-on-spotify-safely-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on the triangle icon"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Speed-Up-Slow-Down-Audio-Files-on-Spotify-App"><a href="#Method-2-Speed-Up-Slow-Down-Audio-Files-on-Spotify-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Speed Up&#x2F;Slow Down Audio Files on Spotify App"></a>Method 2: Speed Up&#x2F;Slow Down Audio Files on Spotify App</h3><p>It is also possible to <strong>slow down the music app Spotify</strong> using the solution, but mainly for podcasts, not songs. Here are the main steps for the process.</p><p><strong>For mobile users:</strong></p><p>Step1: Open the Spotify app on your smartphone &gt; choose a podcast.</p><p>Step2: When the audio starts playing, you can click the Change Speed button at the bottom-left side of the screen.

The steps for each option are mentioned- follow them carefully to ensure the best results with the process.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-immerse-in-fun-the-top-samsung-gear-vr-games/"><u>[Updated] Immerse in Fun  The Top Samsung Gear VR Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-excellent-unrestricted-pubg-visual-sequences/"><u>[Updated] Excellent Unrestricted PUBG Visual Sequences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-expertly-elevating-images-premier-frame-apps-in-2e-24/"><u>[Updated] Expertly Elevating Images  Premier Frame Apps in 2E '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-highest-rated-10-apps-to-watch-golf-and-soccer-in-the-moment/"><u>2024 Approved  Highest Rated 10 Apps to Watch Golf & Soccer in the Moment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-hits-and-misses-the-photographers-account/"><u>[Updated] Hits and Misses  The Photographer's Account</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/gigglegallery-log-in-and-make-magic-videos-for-2024/"><u>GiggleGallery  Log In and Make Magic Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/iconic-stock-pictures-from-ordinary-to-internet-fame-for-2024/"><u>Iconic Stock Pictures  From Ordinary to Internet Fame for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-premier-listing-top-5-free-vector-graphics-online-hubs/"><u>[New] Premier Listing  Top 5 FREE Vector Graphics Online Hubs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-activation-lock-on-the-apple-iphone-x-without-previous-owner-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Remove Activation Lock On the Apple iPhone X Without Previous Owner?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-retrieve-lost-contacts-from-rog-phone-7-ultimate-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>Best Android Data Recovery - Retrieve Lost Contacts from ROG Phone 7 Ultimate.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/refresh-your-digital-realm-selecting-splendid-windows-11-walls/"><u>Refresh Your Digital Realm  Selecting Splendid Windows 11 Walls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-the-secrets-of-shopee-livestream-selling-system-for-2024/"><u>New Unveiling the Secrets of Shopee Livestream Selling System for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-realme-11x-5g-location-on-skout-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Realme 11X 5G Location on Skout | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-extract-youtube-trailers-and-more/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Extract YouTube Trailers & More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-tutorial-screen-skype-via-obs/"><u>[New] Ultimate Tutorial  Screen Skype via OBS</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

They offer a visual guide to creating delicious menu items that range from delicious entrees to kid-friendly snacks.</p><p>If you would like to create some of these food videos yourself, this article will help you shoot the most appealing food videos possible.</p><h2 id="5-Tips-for-Shooting-Food-Videos"><a href="#5-Tips-for-Shooting-Food-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5 Tips for Shooting Food Videos"></a>5 Tips for Shooting Food Videos</h2><h4 id="1-Light"><a href="#1-Light" class="headerlink" title="1. Light"></a>1. Light</h4><p>Light is one of the most crucial factors for your video. If the lighting is too bright, your food videography will appear washed out. If the lighting is too dark, food will appear shadowed and hard to see. Neither is a good option, because it does not present a very professional product.</p><p>The best to use is natural lighting. You want a lot of bright natural light, but not streaming directly through your windows as this creates shadows.</p><p>If the kitchen doesn’t work well for you, experiment with other rooms or outside, but be sure to keep furniture and clutter out of your shots.</p><h4 id="2-Audio"><a href="#2-Audio" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio"></a>2. Audio</h4><p>Audio is one of the main components that sets <a class="link"   href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/visiting-seefood-media-food-videography/" >food videography <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> apart from food photography. There are two viable options. You can either set your video to music, which will help set the tone for your frame speed, or you can use a voice over to provide audible descriptions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-audio.JPG"                      alt="audio"                ></p><h4 id="3-Try-to-Tell-a-Story"><a href="#3-Try-to-Tell-a-Story" class="headerlink" title="3. Try to Tell a Story"></a>3. Try to Tell a Story</h4><p>What seems like an insignificant change can be monumental. When crafting recipe videos, you want to try telling a story.</p><p>For example, instead of showing a mixer you could show a mother helping her child to mix the ingredients together. At the end of the clip, you could either show only the food, or you could show a man walking past the window with his dog in tow.</p><p>Telling a story will help to pull watchers into your video so they watch through until the end. It’s all about making viewers as invested as possible in a very short time frame.</p><p>If you don’t start pulling them in, such as by telling a story, in the first twenty seconds, they probably won’t continue watching.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/food-sell-a-story.JPG"                      alt="food"                ></p><h4 id="4-Video-Editing"><a href="#4-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="4. Video Editing"></a>4. Video Editing</h4><p>Once the video is shot, you’ll have to do some post-production work. In other words, you need to edit your video. This is more time consuming than with food photography, because you must edit by frame, place to music, add title frames, and so on.</p><p>One major mistake people make with their food videos is the use of too many transitions or cut-scenes, such as fading, zoom outs, etc.</p><p>The best way to edit your videos is for quality, with a minimum of 90-97% straight shots – meaning no transitions are used.</p><h4 id="5-Decoration"><a href="#5-Decoration" class="headerlink" title="5. Decoration"></a>5. Decoration</h4><p>Some people will choose to shoot their videos using bold, bright colors in their food and setting.</p><p>Others may decide that a simple setting – such as a classic wooden table with nothing more than a small flower vase – is more suitable for the dish they are creating.</p><p>Both are great choices, but the key is to base your settings off your dish, ensuring the area surrounding the food is complementary and not contrasting.</p><p>Videographers may choose to use other techniques to make the final dish pop.</p><p>This could include food carving, plating techniques, or even just the use of high-tech equipment which has the potential to capture even the tiniest food fragment in vivid detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/food-decoration.JPG"                      alt="decoration food"                ></p><h2 id="Equipment"><a href="#Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Equipment"></a>Equipment</h2><h4 id="1-Smart-Phone"><a href="#1-Smart-Phone" class="headerlink" title="1. Smart Phone"></a>1. Smart Phone</h4><p>One way to shoot food videos is with your smart phone. To do this, use the built-in camera feature set to take video in landscape mode (this looks the best).</p><p>Hold very still to prevent shaking, and simply hold the screen for autofocus and exposure prior to beginning your film.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-7-plus-4k-smartphone.jpg"                      alt="smart phone"                ></p><h4 id="2-Lens"><a href="#2-Lens" class="headerlink" title="2. Lens"></a>2. Lens</h4><p>If you are going to shoot with a camera, you need either a mirrorless camera or DSLR. A standard click-and-shoot will not provide a high enough quality of video. Along with a high-quality camera comes the need for a high-quality lens.</p><p>The lens you shoot with should be able to zoom in or out on the food. You’ll want to avoid a lens that presents static, or has any nicks, chips, or cuts in the glass.</p><p>As for the shooting itself, you can feel free to experiment with lenses that offer unique styles, such as soft or hard</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fujinon-mk18-55mm-t2.9-lens.jpg"                      alt="lens"                ></p><h4 id="3-Tripod"><a href="#3-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="3. Tripod"></a>3. Tripod</h4><p>Another thing you’ll want when shooting with a camera is a tripod. A tripod is necessary because it holds the camera steady, as well as allows you to be present in the video if desired.</p><p>You can find a cheap tripod at many chain stores to get you started, although you may want to invest in a better one in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gitzo-mountaineer-series-2-carbon-fiber-tripod.jpg"                      alt="tripod"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This basic guide should give you a solid start in creating top-of-the-line food videography for your social media accounts.</p><p>If you find your first video isn’t as amazing as you’d thought it would be, remember that it takes time to become a master at something. With practice, you will see the videos shot progressively becoming more professional.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload

The original version of the drone was incredibly fun to fly but the Bebop 2 makes new improvements in performance, battery life and video quality. Although the controls for the Bebop are not as precise as some other types of drones on the market like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DJI Phantom 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the performance and the attractive video that this drone can capture make it a true performance leader in the market.</p><p> The Parrot Bebop is a drone that was in development for over two years since the initial release of the original drone. It comes with a very reasonable price point at under $600 and it is capable of completing over 25 min of autonomous flight before going back to base. The specs on this drone make it a leader in amateur <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >filmmaking, photographs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and more. This is a drone that’s well-suited for use both indoors and outdoors and they commonly go on sale allowing many people to start up their drone hobby without having to invest thousands of dollars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2.jpg"                      alt="parrot bebop 2"                ></p><h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Parrot-Bebop-2"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Parrot-Bebop-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Parrot Bebop 2"></a>Pros and Cons of Parrot Bebop 2</h2><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Tt’s extremely lightweight design</li><li>The cameras respectable with a fisheye lens capable of capturing 30 frames per second at 1080 P</li><li>The device can also capture 14 megapixel shots with fairly stable movement</li><li>The battery life has more than doubled allowing up to 25 min of flight time</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Camera functions have not been improved greatly from the previous version</li><li>Image distortions</li><li>The control sticks can also sometimes be quick to go unresponsive long before the parrot reaches its extended service range</li></ul><h2 id="Complete-review-for-Parrot-Bebop-2"><a href="#Complete-review-for-Parrot-Bebop-2" class="headerlink" title="Complete review for Parrot Bebop 2"></a>Complete review for Parrot Bebop 2</h2><h4 id="1-Features-and-specs"><a href="#1-Features-and-specs" class="headerlink" title="1.  Features and specs"></a>1.  Features and specs</h4><p> The main features for this device are it’s improved stable movement with a three axis accelerometer and ultrasound sensor. These improved sensors and waypoint controls make the process of actually flying one of these drones very easy. The motor is also known for its speed and its capable of reaching a height of 100 m in just 18 seconds after takeoff. This is a very fast and highflying drone. The improved battery life of up to 25 min. with a 2700 mA battery is a considerable improvement for this drone as well. The two nicest features which are available for new drone flyers are the return home feature where you can set a waypoint for the drone to land after it runs out of battery as well as the free flight three application. The free flight application is one of the easiest ways that you can control your drone with the help of a tablet or smartphone and set waypoints for capturing the shots you want.</p><h4 id="2-Design"><a href="#2-Design" class="headerlink" title="2.  Design"></a>2.  Design</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2-design.png"                      alt="parrot bebop 2 design"                ></p><p> The design of this drone has definitely been improved for performance as well as resiliency. The previous version of the parrot was fairly simple to break but this newest version is much stronger and easier to control especially with the help of the application. This is a drone that has definitely been designed with beginner users in mind. The only design flaw with this drone is that the camera was not updated in any way. Parrot makes the process of ordering extra parts extremely simple through their online store and you can keep this drone running over an extended amount of time quite easily.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-Life"><a href="#3-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.  Battery Life"></a>3.  Battery Life</h4><p> The battery life on this drone is excellent for the type of video that shoots as well as the controls offered on the device. Previous versions of the parrot could only fly for 11 min. but this drone can fly uninterrupted for 25 minutes or less. The improved battery life on this drone is comparable with others in the price point but not many of them feature the same quality of image.</p><h4 id="4-Flight-performance"><a href="#4-Flight-performance" class="headerlink" title="4.  Flight performance"></a>4.  Flight performance</h4><p> This is a high-performing drone that has great stability controls and an application that can ease the process of flight. The return home feature helps to protect the drone in the event of a battery problem or when the user is finished filming. As landing these drones can be some of the most difficult aspects of operation, flight performance with a return home feature is one of the easiest ways to protect it.</p><h4 id="5-Control-Range"><a href="#5-Control-Range" class="headerlink" title="5.  Control Range"></a>5.  Control Range</h4><p> Parrot does have an accessory to extend the control range of the Bebop 2 to 2 km. The drone out of the box has a range of 300 m to work with when using the controls. If you plan on using the drone regularly, the extra control range can be very helpful.</p><h4 id="6-Camera"><a href="#6-Camera" class="headerlink" title="6.  Camera"></a>6.  Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2-camera.jpg"                      alt="parrot bebop 2 camera"                ></p><p> The 14 megapixel fisheye lens camera is backed up by 8 GB of onboard storage. The cameras capable of capturing 1080 P video at 30 frames per second and it does produce a fairly good quality image. Some users have made light complaints about lens flare and a few other distortion qualities but overall, it’s difficult to find a drone and camera built in combo that can produce an image this good, for the same price.</p><h4 id="7-The-free-flight-app"><a href="#7-The-free-flight-app" class="headerlink" title="7.  The free flight app"></a>7.  The free flight app</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-free-app.gif"                      alt="parrot bebop 2 free app"                ></p><p> The free flight app is a huge asset to this drone. Not only can you use controls from your smart phone or tablet to see from the drone, but you can also set waypoints using the tablet using GPS functions and rely on the autonomous flight capabilities as well as the return home functions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ideal-mic-matches-for-dynamic-camera-use/"><u>2024 Approved  Ideal Mic Matches for Dynamic Camera Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-infusing-personality-with-custom-fonts-in-ae-workflows/"><u>2024 Approved  Infusing Personality with Custom Fonts in AE Workflows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovate-brand-identity-complimentary-logo-templates-customization/"><u>In 2024, Innovate Brand Identity  Complimentary Logo Templates Customization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-iconic-stop-motion-animations-15-best-ever/"><u>[Updated] Iconic Stop-Motion Animations - #15 Best Ever</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/honorable-highlights-elite-websites-for-obtaining-snapalert-beats-for-2024/"><u>Honorable Highlights  Elite Websites for Obtaining SnapAlert Beats for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-evolving-from-static-snapshots-to-moving-visuals/"><u>[New] Evolving From Static Snapshots to Moving Visuals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-monochrome-to-multicolor-learning-about-the-art-of-green-screens/"><u>2024 Approved  From Monochrome to Multicolor  Learning About the Art of Green Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-realme-c67-5g-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Realme C67 5G?

You can mount this device on your guitar as well as to front side of a ski. This device is also known by the name Hero Session but you should never confuse it with GoPro Hero5 Session that is a recent feature rich model.</p><p> On the other side, Polaroid Cube+ possesses size same as that of its predecessor Polaroid Cube.

While there are many different ways to set up lighting, some methods are more effective than others.</p><p>Therefore, this article will give you a complete guide on how to set up your lighting to make your videos stand out.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Guide"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How-to Guide"></a>Part 1. How-to Guide</h2><p><strong><em>1) Preparation</em></strong></p><p>Before we get started, you may need to prepare some things to set up your lighting:</p><p><strong>1. Powerful LED Lights</strong></p><p>LED lights are a huge step up from traditional incandescent lighting because they generate much less heat and energy. Also, you can change the color temperature and use different lighting effects.</p><p><strong>2. Softbox</strong></p><p>Softbox can help you diffuse and spread the light on the subject.</p><p><strong>3. Fresnel lens</strong></p><p>A Fresnel lens is an optional attachment that can bounce the light off of the ceiling of your studio and diffuses the light to look soft.</p><p><strong><em>2) Steps</em></strong></p><p>For this tutorial, we will use the Three-Point Lighting technique:</p><h5 id="Step1-Set-the-Key-Light"><a href="#Step1-Set-the-Key-Light" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Set the Key Light"></a>Step1 Set the Key Light</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-1.jpg"                      alt="set the key light"                ></p><p>The key light is the main light that illuminates the subject. You can place it in the front and slightly to one side. For this key light, we use an LED called Aputure 300X as an example, and with a soft box called light Dome 2.</p><h5 id="Step2-Set-the-Fill-Light"><a href="#Step2-Set-the-Fill-Light" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Set the Fill Light"></a>Step2 Set the Fill Light</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-2.jpg"                      alt="set the fill light"                ></p><p>The fill light is used to fill in the shadows created by the key light. It is usually placed on the opposite side of the subject. For the fill light, we use an Aputure 300D with a fresnel lens attachment.</p><h5 id="Step3-Set-the-Backlight"><a href="#Step3-Set-the-Backlight" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Set the Backlight"></a>Step3 Set the Backlight</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-3.jpg"                      alt="set the backlight"                ></p><p>For this tutorial, we use Aperture 120d as the backlight and lift it up into the air with a c-stand so it can light the subject from above. It helps to separate the talent from the background and give the audience a full view of the set</p><h5 id="Step4-Use-Practical-Lights"><a href="#Step4-Use-Practical-Lights" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Use Practical Lights"></a>Step4 Use Practical Lights</h5><p>Practical lights appear on the camera to add some visual flair. It can be any light source that isn’t meant for lighting the subject. For example, we use a green lamp to help our background pop as it casts a nice orange light on the back wall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-4.jpg"                      alt="use practical lights"                ></p><p>Then, we also have a LED ring light that shines toward the camera. The light adds even more light to the frame and gives a slight backlight to the subject.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-5.jpg"                      alt="led ring light"                ></p><p>Finally, we have a few other small LED lights like this unicorn to put in the background. This lighting helps us to get even more visual flair out of our shots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-6.jpg"                      alt="other small led lights"                ></p><p>After setting up all the lighting above, you can take a look at the comparison below:</p><p><strong>Using Key Light only</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-7.jpg"                      alt="using key light only"                ></p><p><strong>Using Key Light + Fill + Backlight</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-8.jpg"                      alt="using key light + fill + backlight"                ></p><p><strong><em>3) Pro Tips: The light setting</em></strong></p><p>We usually set the lights around 50% brightness and a color temperature of 5600K.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-9.jpg"                      alt="the light setting"                ></p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, you learned something about lighting by taking a look at our setup.

Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works.

Most of the people find it little awkward when they use ultra wide monitors for the very first time because the ratio between vertical and horizontal space appears improperly matched. But once you start working on it, you will find it so useful.</p><p> Moving ahead towards 4K that is well known as Ultra HD resolution, it provides 3840x2160 resolution level that means you can expect more space horizontally. 27” and 24” is most common screen size offered for 4K content where most of the users prefer to scale their interface for improving appearance of text and usability of windows. The 4K monitors also assist users to enjoy 1080p content on same screen so you can have easy access to all your video clips on single terminal. The best thing to know is that 4K monitors are becoming cheap day by day with their increasing demand so you can easily plan to buy one. But note that it is necessary to connect these monitors with high performance computer to enjoy perfect 4K gaming experience.</p><h2 id="Section-1-UltraWide-Vs-4K-Monitor-for-Everyday-Use"><a href="#Section-1-UltraWide-Vs-4K-Monitor-for-Everyday-Use" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: UltraWide Vs 4K Monitor for Everyday Use"></a>Section 1: UltraWide Vs 4K Monitor for Everyday Use</h2><p> As we have already discussed that ultra-wide displays promise 3440 pixels in horizontal space but the vertical side have only 1440 pixels.
