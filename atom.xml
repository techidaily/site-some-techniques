    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Hue-Mastery-Interface"><a href="#Hue-Mastery-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Hue Mastery Interface"></a>Hue Mastery Interface</h2><p><em>Before you start working on any video editing, you need to have a good overall understanding of working with color in video. To guide you through the process, we’ll explain the basics of color and outline the best color editing software packages and apps for fine-tuning the colors in your footage.</em></p><p>Color sorting is an exciting practice of patience, skillful tinkering, and a feeling for atmosphere. Creating stellar looks for a photo or video is a fun way to create a visual experience while maintaining a level of artistic integrity. While advanced artists may prefer larger software programs like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve, there are excellent, simpler applications built entirely for beginners. In fact, you don’t have to be a beginner to use these apps, as many of them use more manual controls for precise adjustments. The advancements readily available for iOS and iPad these days are stellar, and we’re here to help point you in the right direction.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-correction"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-correction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color correction?"></a>Part 1. What is color correction?</h2><p>Color correction refers to the process of adjusting each clip of footage to meet a consistent standard of appearance. Basically, it’s about correcting the underlying image issues by balancing the colors, making white appear white, black appear black, and making sure everything is even. The goal is to match the video footage to a standard that would accurately represent how the human eye would see it.</p><p>An example of this is when you are shooting outdoors during the day. During the day, the quality of the sun will change, and some shots of your video will not match. This is why color correction is important because it will make your video look like it was all shot at the same time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-app-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-color-correction-app"><a href="#Part-2-Best-color-correction-app" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

If the colors in your video don’t look right, don’t panic because you can quickly fix the problem with a video color correction app on your Android or iPhone device.</p><p>To help you choose, we’ve compiled a shortlist of the 5 best video color correction apps for your smartphone below.</p><p><strong>Choose the best video color grading app for your mobile phone</strong></p><h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

How to zoom in&#x2F;out Google Meet"></a>Part 2. How to zoom in&#x2F;out Google Meet</h2><p>The simplest way to do it in Google Meet is by clicking or tapping to zoom in.

The configurations you wish to modify such as Camera: for this option, choose the camera device of your choice as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/setup-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="setup google meet"                ></p><p>Step2 Hover over the shared screen and click the Pin symbol to save it. Go to the “Webcam Settings” window, pick the “Camera Control” option at the top, then select the webcam from the drop-down list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/google-meeting-settings-panel.jpg"                      alt="google meeting settings panel"                ></p><p>Step3 The “Layout” option is next to the slider; click it. Adjust it in the direction the zoom-in zooms in using the slider. The “Ok” button may assist you in making all of your decisions. Select the Minimize icon while your cursor is on your own picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/layout-options-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="layout options google meet"                ></p><p>Step4 Change your Layout to “Focus” in the Meet Menu (three dots). By repeatedly hitting CTRL+ minus (-), you can zoom out (!). The Meet controls at the bottom get smaller as a result. With CTRL+0, you may subsequently reverse your zoom.</p><p>Step5 To turn off the browser UI, press F11. By hitting F11 once again, full screen mode may be ended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/full-screen-mode-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="full screen mode google meet"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-and-tricks-to-use-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-and-tricks-to-use-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Tips and tricks to use Google Meet"></a>Part 3. Tips and tricks to use Google Meet</h2><p>Those who have a Google Account are able to start a meeting. It’s simple to make one if you don’t already have one. Especially if you have a Gmail account, you undoubtedly already have one. The sooner you learn how to use them, the sooner you’ll be an expert on Meet calls. Google has numerous handy keyboard shortcuts built in, including a keyboard shortcut to display you all of the keyboard shortcuts. Start using these methods without ever taking your eyes off your camera if you truly want to wow your colleagues on your next Google Meet conversation.</p><ul><li>By testing your audio inputs and outputs before you join a conversation using Google Meet’s virtual green room function, you may save yourself a lot of humiliation and save your coworkers some annoyance.</li><li>You don’t need to worry about having your eyes crossed if you’re on a really busy conversation and can’t exactly concentrate on where the main speaker is in your grid or tile view. To maintain your attention on the primary speaker without straining your eyes, all you have to do is pin them to the top row of your grid.</li><li>Google Meet has you covered whether you want to record a meeting for posterity, share a copy of it with coworkers who couldn’t make it, or refer to it afterwards. All you have to do to start recording meetings is choose that option from the three-dot menu at the bottom of the screen.</li><li>Numerous individuals are often present during Google Meet calls. You should turn on the grid or tile layout if you want to be sure to see them all, or at least as many as you can. Simply choose the Tiled option from the three-dot menu at the bottom of the screen. You may then use the slider in the pop-out window to show 6 to 49 more participants.</li><li>If you are the call’s owner, you may turn off everyone else’s microphone by placing your mouse over the volume symbol and selecting Silence.</li><li>For added convenience, Google Meet lets you cast a meeting to another screen. The TV in your living room or conference room may be projected from your laptop or desktop, in other words.</li><li>Similar to the subtitle feature seen on other applications like Skype, this feature allows you to have the dialogue show in text on your screen in real-time so that you can more easily understand what is being said during video chats. It is exclusively offered in English. Click Turn on Captions in the Meet’s bottom right corner to turn it on.</li><li>Users of Google Meet will be able to pin many individuals to the top of their tiled screen. This will be especially useful if you have meetings where two or three people talk the majority of the time.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>You may show additional information on your Google Meet by zooming in and out. On a slideshow map, for instance, zooming out reveals more of the region around your position. When dealing with many documents, zooming out might help you fit everything on one screen so you can see it all at once. You may fit more on your screen by zooming out. You may just need to zoom in or out on a Google Meet momentarily. You can rapidly get your screen back to its original perspective after zooming in or out.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i

Right? Not anymore, as we have already figured this out for you. Ahead, you will learn what podcast script is. How to write one? Also, we have listed some pro tips and added some ready-to-go templates to help you get started. So, stay connected till last.</p><h2 id="What-Is-a-Podcast-Script-and-Why-Do-We-Need-One"><a href="#What-Is-a-Podcast-Script-and-Why-Do-We-Need-One" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Podcast Script, and Why Do We Need One?"></a>What Is a Podcast Script, and Why Do We Need One?</h2><p>A podcast script is simply a plan for the podcast that outlines the main topics in a sequence. Based on your feasibility and the type of show, it can be detailed or include the essential things. However, the majority of podcast scripts adhere to the following basic format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-write-podcast-script-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast script"                ></p><h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p>The intro is supposed to build the audience’s interest as soon as they start listening to the podcast. So here, you will warmly welcome your listeners, say some icebreaker sentences, give your intro, and state teaser lines about the podcast.</p><p>*Pro tip: Don’t reveal everything; keep it a little mysterious to hook listeners till the end.</p><h3 id="Guest-intro"><a href="#Guest-intro" class="headerlink" title="Guest intro"></a>Guest intro</h3><p>The guest introduction is crucial because people listen attentively if an expert addresses the topic. So, courteously welcome your guest, and mention his name, profession, achievements, and background (if related to the topic).</p><h3 id="Sponsor-message"><a href="#Sponsor-message" class="headerlink" title="Sponsor message"></a>Sponsor message</h3><p>Every brand has a distinct set of preferences; sometimes, they give you a script that you have to follow word for word, and other times they leave it up to you. In either case, the sponsor messaging should look natural and blend with the layout of your show. Besides, a persuasive sponsor message script will motivate listeners to buy brand products, thereby boosting your number of sponsors—a win-win situation.</p><h3 id="Segue"><a href="#Segue" class="headerlink" title="Segue"></a>Segue</h3><p>When there are multiple segments in an episode, transitions make switching from one to the next seamless. For example, it may be a piece of music, a phrase, motion graphics, etc.</p><h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>It’s challenging to retain everything after listening to a significant amount of information. Hence, to facilitate listeners, summarize the entire episode and revise the key takeaways.</p><h3 id="Outro"><a href="#Outro" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p>It’s time to acknowledge the listeners and guests for their precious time. To tie listeners to your show, you can mention references, make announcements, and reveal the topic and air time of the upcoming episode.</p><h3 id="Call-to-action"><a href="#Call-to-action" class="headerlink" title="Call to action"></a>Call to action</h3><p>A straightforward call to action can boost the reach of the podcast. Here is how?</p><p>Invite the audience to leave a review, share their thoughts about the topic in the comment section, and show your availability to interact with them and answer their queries.</p><h3 id="Why-do-you-need-one"><a href="#Why-do-you-need-one" class="headerlink" title="Why do you need one?"></a>Why do you need one?</h3><p>Having said that, let me tell you why writing a podcast script is crucial before you hit the record button. First, having a podcast script will simplify things for you and your guest, as you’ll know the next point already; otherwise, you will make a mess.</p><p>Averting unnecessary gaps and saving time requires planning the segment order and making a list of the main points to discuss. The script ensures you stay on topic and organized to keep listeners interested. A well-planned podcast also requires less effort in post-production. So if you want a streamlined recording experience, take your time and craft a top-notch podcast script.</p><h2 id="Podcast-Script-Outline-Templates"><a href="#Podcast-Script-Outline-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Podcast Script Outline Templates"></a>Podcast Script Outline Templates</h2><p>As promised, it’s time to introduce you to the three most common podcast script templates. Pick the one that best suits your needs and take your podcast to the next level.</p><h3 id="Template-1-The-Word-For-Word-Podcast-Script"><a href="#Template-1-The-Word-For-Word-Podcast-Script" class="headerlink" title="Template 1: The Word-For-Word Podcast Script"></a>Template 1: The Word-For-Word Podcast Script</h3><p>The first right candidate for the word-for-word script is the one about to land in the podcast world. All that is left to do is carry them out correctly since most things have already been written down. This format should also be used by someone presenting a lot of statistical data, facts, and figures.</p><p><strong>Structure</strong></p><ul><li>Intro: Introduce yourself, the topic of discussion, and the guests if there; episode teaser (Span: ___ )</li><li>[Sponsor message]</li><li>[Theme music]</li><li>Topic 1: _____(Span: __ )</li><li>Principal point</li><li>Supporting points</li><li>Quotations, data, or other facts</li><li>Segue (can be a phrase, a piece of music, or a sound effect)</li><li>Topic 2: _______(Span: __ )</li><li>Principal point</li><li>Supporting points</li><li>Quotations, data, or other facts</li><li>[Sponsor message]</li><li>Topic 3: _______(Span: __ )</li><li>Principal point</li><li>Supporting points</li><li>Quotations, data, or other facts</li><li>Outro: _____ (Span: __ )</li><li>Overview</li><li>Call to action</li><li>[Closing theme music]</li></ul><p><strong>Template</strong></p><p>[Intro music]</p><p>Intro:</p><p>Hello and welcome to (show name); I’m (hostname).

Consider delivering the dialogues in your podcasts like a story, no matter what kind. Podcasts with a narrative format are popular because listeners’ interest grows as the story unfolds. Hence, keeping them curious to find out what happens next.</p><h3 id="3-Mark-ups-your-script"><a href="#3-Mark-ups-your-script" class="headerlink" title="(3) Mark-ups your script"></a>(3) Mark-ups your script</h3><p>A script devoid of notes is merely a piece of paper with text. “Mark-ups” is the practice of adding notes to scripts on specific elements, such as giggles, emphasis, pauses, etc. Being humans, we have emotions; therefore, adding emotions to your script will help your podcast sound like a casual, enjoyable conversation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-write-podcast-script-10.jpg"                      alt="podcast script"                ></p><p>Here is an example of an annotated podcast script taken from the “<a class="link"   href="https://lowerstreet.co/how-to/write-podcast-script#how-to-manage-a-brand-sponsor-script" >Lower Street <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ website. As you can see, it depicts where to adjust the tone, take pause, put emphasis, etc. Also, you can annotate your writing in your style by adding certain symbols or utilizing various font styles.</p><h3 id="4-Always-Close-with-A-Call-To-Action"><a href="#4-Always-Close-with-A-Call-To-Action" class="headerlink" title="(4) Always Close with A Call To Action"></a>(4) Always Close with A Call To Action</h3><p>You are coming to the crucial section that will help expand your fan base. The Call To Action (CTA) is typically included in the outro, but you can experiment by placing it after the intro part. Whether it’s an offer to join the group or a way to sign up for your newsletter, present it as simply as you can.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Pro-Tips-to-Nail-Your-Podcast-Scripts-for-Beginners"><a href="#Bonus-Pro-Tips-to-Nail-Your-Podcast-Scripts-for-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Pro Tips to Nail Your Podcast Scripts for Beginners"></a>Bonus: Pro Tips to Nail Your Podcast Scripts for Beginners</h2><p>Starting out the journey in the podcast world may not be a piece of cake for everyone. But don’t worry, as we are going to reveal some pro tips to nail your podcast script without much effort.</p><h3 id="How-do-I-write-my-first-podcast"><a href="#How-do-I-write-my-first-podcast" class="headerlink" title="How do I write my first podcast?"></a>How do I write my first podcast?</h3><p>Writing your first podcast script can be challenging, there’s no doubt about it, but if you keep the following ideas in mind while writing, you can produce a good one.</p><p><strong>(1) Avoid saying, ‘Subscribe or follow wherever you get your podcasts!</strong></p><p>The audience should be given a straightforward task, which we have stated many times previously. There is a high likelihood that people will ignore you if you ask them to “Subscribe or follow wherever you get your podcasts” or something similar.</p><p>Make sure to properly guide and simplify the task for the listeners if you want them to fulfill it. The links to other platforms where your podcast is available can be either attached in the notes section or included in the podcast itself.</p><p><strong>(2) Don’t overdo it with CTAs – it’s good to have a range, but stick to one or two per episode.</strong></p><p>Sometimes podcasters get overenthusiastic and stuff each episode with CTAs. That’s insane… Right? Respecting your audience’s time is just as crucial as getting views; failing to do so will result in losing them.</p><p>It’s good to have a range of CTAs, but stick to one or two per episode and try the rest in future episodes. It’s okay to repeat that one or two CTAs a couple of times during the episode to increase the probability that viewers will follow through.</p><p><strong>(3) Mention that it’s free to follow or subscribe</strong></p><p>Along with the CTA message, it’s a good idea to mention that following or subscribing is free. However, people may think they need to pay to subscribe because everything is shifting to a charged model from a free one.</p><p><strong>(4) Know the animating question of your podcast episode, and focus on answering it</strong></p><p>One of the most effective ways to keep the listeners interested throughout the episode is to communicate answers to their questions about that topic. The animating question is that a specific part of your episode answers an existing question. The key to finding the animating questions is “Research,” which will help you focus on the answers listeners want to hear.</p><h2 id="Podcast-script-Hot-FAQs"><a href="#Podcast-script-Hot-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Podcast script Hot FAQs"></a>Podcast script Hot FAQs</h2><p>Sometimes the curiosity of people frightens me. Anyway, please don’t bother yourself, as it’s not a quote—just a random thought. Folks often come up with questions about podcast scripts; hence, the answers to those queries are provided below.</p><h3 id="1-What-podcast-format-is-most-popular"><a href="#1-What-podcast-format-is-most-popular" class="headerlink" title="1. What podcast format is most popular?"></a>1. What podcast format is most popular?</h3><p>The “Interview” podcast format is currently the most popular. Experts are invited and interviewed to acquire their opinions on a topic in an interview format.</p><h3 id="2-What-makes-a-good-podcast-script"><a href="#2-What-makes-a-good-podcast-script" class="headerlink" title="2. What makes a good podcast script?"></a>2. What makes a good podcast script?</h3><p>The discourse on a podcast should feel human rather than robotic; thus, the script should provide some flexibility for improvisation. However, beginners often prefer a word-for-word script with all the information ready to deliver.</p><h3 id="3-Do-you-need-to-have-a-podcast-script"><a href="#3-Do-you-need-to-have-a-podcast-script" class="headerlink" title="3. Do you need to have a podcast script?"></a>3. Do you need to have a podcast script?</h3><p>It’s not a hard and fast rule to always have a podcast script, especially if you are a pro. But a bit of planning and organizing things beforehand can simplify your workflow.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The crux of our discussion is that a compelling podcast script makes it simple to put ideas into action when your ultimate objective is to create high-quality content. Decide a format for your podcast if you haven’t yet, pick up the script template accordingly, modify and mark up as per your needs and you are almost done.</p><p><a class="link"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Use-LUTs-to-OBS-Studio-Download-Free-LUTs"><a href="#How-to-Use-LUTs-to-OBS-Studio-Download-Free-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="How to Use LUTs to OBS Studio &amp; Download Free LUTs"></a>How to Use LUTs to OBS Studio &amp; Download Free LUTs</h2><p>We’ve all seen filters on social media that change the appearance or feel of your photos. They might even improve your appearance. You can use an identical impact on video, and these are known as LUTs. In OBS, you can add them to a video or your webcam, which will change your face cam’s appearance or increase its quality.</p><h2 id="Why-do-we-need-to-use-LUTs-in-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Why-do-we-need-to-use-LUTs-in-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Why do we need to use LUTs in OBS Studio?"></a>Why do we need to use LUTs in OBS Studio?</h2><p>Color grading presets called to look up tables can be used in video editing applications and OBS. They can be utilized to alter the tone of your photo or just add to its vibrancy. LUTs allow you to apply filters to your image in order to increase its quality or produce a dramatic effect. It may even save you money on a more expensive camera. Here are some reasons why you should use LUTs.</p><h3 id="1-It-brings-perfection-with-time-management"><a href="#1-It-brings-perfection-with-time-management" class="headerlink" title="1. It brings perfection with time management"></a>1. It brings perfection with time management</h3><p>LUTs aid in pleasing the client, completing the job on time, and achieving magnificent cinematic hues. A LUT is easy to use and only requires a few clicks. Whether lifestyle, personal, or business, some projects might take a long time to edit. Some projects have a very tight schedule, and editing can even be done overnight! LUTs come in handy in this situation. Most experts have had clients who demand video as soon as possible but have no idea how long it takes to create a video! It takes a lot longer than they anticipate.</p><p>However, you still want to provide a good project; color grading might take a long time to go through all of the clips and make them appear beautiful, and you may not have the time. Here, LUTs can definitely help.</p><h3 id="2-It-provides-a-polished-finish"><a href="#2-It-provides-a-polished-finish" class="headerlink" title="2. It provides a polished finish"></a>2. It provides a polished finish</h3><p>Lookup tables might save you time when editing, but for many creative filmmakers and editors, LUTs are a way of polishing the final appearance of a film. When color grading is poorly done, it can impair the aesthetic of a movie and distract the audience. The beautiful thing about LUTs is that most of them on the market are created by other videographers, so you know they’ll work on your movies right out of the box; all you have to do is make little tweaks to match the vision you have in your brain. If you’ve never used LUTs before but want to take your short films to an extraordinary level, try cinematic LUTs, which will give you that blockbuster vibe on a budget.</p><h3 id="3-A-command-to-adaptability"><a href="#3-A-command-to-adaptability" class="headerlink" title="3. A command to adaptability"></a>3. A command to adaptability</h3><p>They’re highly adaptable. LUTs can be utilized to convert Log film back to the Rec709 standard, making the Log color profile more approachable to users who don’t have years of color grading expertise. Professionals generally employ log color space to increase dynamic range and sustain shadows and highlights in contrasting scenes. Conversion LUTs now assist in getting over the arduous task of color grading Log footage.</p><p>Many pros and amateurs use conversion LUTs to make this step considerably easier. Many LUTs, notably creative LUTs, are compatible with a video that has been converted to Rec709 from Log. For use on Rec709 standard color film, creative LUTs typically preserve the cinematic and stylish colors. Rec709 is the most common color profile used by most cameras, making it the easiest to work with.</p><h3 id="4-It-gives-a-hint-of-professionalism"><a href="#4-It-gives-a-hint-of-professionalism" class="headerlink" title="4. It gives a hint of professionalism"></a>4. It gives a hint of professionalism</h3><p>Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Davinci Resolve, and other programs can use LUTs. They’re ideal for any video where you want to create a distinct appearance or vibe. LUTs are essential for any aspiring or established filmmaker. They’re utilized to quickly create high-quality visuals that give any project a polished look. They can also be used to give your video an overall color tone.</p><h3 id="5-Creativity-at-your-fingertips"><a href="#5-Creativity-at-your-fingertips" class="headerlink" title="5. Creativity at your fingertips"></a>5. Creativity at your fingertips</h3><p>LUTs are a quick and easy way to achieve colors. Consider LUTs to be color grading professionals who share their knowledge via a LUT file. They do all of the heavy lifting, so you don’t have to.

In that sense, we’re referring to CapCut, an app created by the same people who created TikTok. Many people like it because of its simple interface, availability, and ease of use.</p><p>CapCut includes an extensive library of royalty-free effects and music that may significantly improve the quality of your videos.

The version is free for use, with no watermarks or other restrictions, and is said to be highly effective in a variety of editing tasks for several of today’s streaming video demands.</p><p>The editing functions themselves are essential enough but not very sturdy. The transitioning is also nicer than what you’ll get on many free applications, but certainly a step less than you’ll get on more significant NLE sites. VN Video Editor is best suited for editing footage shot straight from your phone (but not in-app). The textual and subtitle options are ideal for creating material for TikTok or YouTube.</p><p>To play a reverse video with VN Video Editor on Android, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install VN and launch it on your Android phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom and tap <strong>New Project.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Navigate the video you wish to reverse and select it by tapping it and upload it by pressing the <strong>blue -&gt;</strong> button in the right corner.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now slide towards the right and click on <strong>Reverse</strong> from the bottom menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-video-vn-video-editor-android.jpg"                      alt="reverse video vn video editor android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After the reverse procedure is complete, click <strong>Export</strong> to save the reversed video.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-reverse-a-video-on-Android-with-PowerDirector-Video-Editor-App"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-reverse-a-video-on-Android-with-PowerDirector-Video-Editor-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to reverse a video on Android with PowerDirector Video Editor App"></a>Part 5: How to reverse a video on Android with PowerDirector Video Editor App</h2><p>PowerDirector is intelligent reverse video software that also has a slew of other valuable functions. This reverse video app enables reverse playback as well as customizable speed.

The transitioning is also nicer than what you’ll get on many free applications, but certainly a step less than you’ll get on more significant NLE sites.

And with refers to my YouTube Channel, the kind of haul that I usually shared with my audiences are something that I bought from different stores and places here in Israel. Kind of interesting, isn’t it? Most specially if you’re someone residing outside of the Holy Land. There are lots of interesting stuff to purchase here like souvenirs from the Old City of Jerusalem.</p><p>People nowadays are searching for something that they want to buy from the wide range of worldly goods out there. And that’s where the Youtubers&#x2F; vloggers came in. They share their videos on YouTube wherein viewers can get some sort of review with a particular item. Like for example, I bought a t-shirt from the Old City of Jerusalem. I’ll show the t-shirt itself; I’ll tell what kind of fabric it has. Is it good or not in my own opinion.

I like to showcase things. Not to brag, but to share information about a certain thing. Tell its cons and pros at some point, depends on what kind of stuff I’m showcasing to the viewers. I will show you the steps with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>First thing first, like all the videos that I’m editing, we need to drag all our video clips to the timeline of our video editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-video-clip-haul.jpg"                      alt="drag video clip haul"                ></p><p>By the way, before we proceed. I’m using Wondershare Filmora as my video editor if you want to know, just for the record.</p><p>Cutting all the unnecessary information that I’ve said during the video, so that we can work as fast as we can afterwards. Just point the timeline scale to the specific part of the video you want to cut and then click the scissor icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/cut-unneed-haul-clips.jpg"                      alt="cut unneed haul clips"                ></p><p>Next is highlight the part of the video that you want to delete and click the trash bin icon and you’re ready to go the next part of it, that you need to omit once again.

Adding all those special effects, sound effects, background music, text, lower third green screen and more. And what you can see in the image below is the default add-on I always attach to all of my videos on YouTube, my default social media watermark on the upper-right corner of it. And usually, it’s static and I added it until the end of a video, just to remind the viewers all of my social media platforms.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you want to be a YouTuber&#x2F;vlogger like us, choose a name that really represents your personal being and make it as simple as it can be, easily to memorize and just one name for all of your social media platforms. In that case, your viewers can easily search your name throughout those said online rostrums.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-name-for-haul-video.jpg"                      alt="choose name for haul video"                ></p><p>The image below shows how I started to market the shirt that I bought from Adidas.

So, in the image below; I insert the name of the Facebook Page where I bought that Tribal inspired shirt. When it comes to street wear, there’s no better brand than <strong><em>Tribal Philippines</em></strong>. It is a brand supported by many great artists, especially in music, if you want to know it’s origin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/insert-brand-name-haul-video_.jpg"                      alt="insert brand name haul video"                ></p><p>Another thing that you can see on my haul video is that I love to showcase my co-YouTuber so that viewers on my channel can check his&#x2F;her channel too.</p><p>I’ll add my outro afterwards and that’s the end of it.

Because many smartphones nowadays offer the best picture quality when it comes to snapping photos using their camera, it is imperative to learn <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong> so the main subject grabs the limelight, hence making the other objects in the background get the least focus.</p><p>That said, when it is said <strong>how to blur photos on iPhone</strong>, it practically means that you are learning the process of blurring the background so the main subject (a person or an object) gets the most attention, and that’s what is explained in the following sections.</p><p>There are multiple ways to get this done. For instance, the background of the photos can be blurred while shooting even on the older iPhones. Likewise, if you already have an image, you can use the Photos app’s built-in effects, or download a third-party program to get the job done. Some of the common methods in this context are described below.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Take a Photo with a Blurred Background</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Add Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone"></a>Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone</h2><p>Portrait mode in the Camera app is available on iPhone 7 Plus and above models. However, if you are using iPhone SE 2020 or iPhone XR, you can blur the background of the images only with the people as the main subject.</p><p>You can learn <strong>how to blur an image on iPhone</strong> using Portrait mode by following the instructions given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch the Camera App</strong></p><p>Grab your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustration), and tab the <strong>Camera</strong> icon from the Home screen to launch the app.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Get to the Portrait Mode and Adjust the Depth</strong></p><p>Swipe-drag the modes present above the <strong>Shutter</strong> button to switch to the <strong>PORTRAIT</strong> option, and tap the main subject on the screen that you want to capture the image of. Next, tap the <strong>f</strong> (<strong>Depth</strong>) icon from the top-right corner, and drag the <strong>Depth</strong> slider to the left to increase the intensity of the blur effect of the background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-portrait-mode-blur-background.jpg"                      alt="iphone portrait mode blur background"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Capture and Access the Photo</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Capture</strong> icon from the bottom-center to capture the image. To access, you can either tap the <strong>Preview</strong> icon from the bottom-left corner, or get to the <strong>Photos</strong> app from the Home screen, go to <strong>Albums</strong>, and access the captured photo from the <strong>Recents</strong> album.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-photo-background-iphone-portrait-mode.jpg"                      alt="blur photo background iphone portrait mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Take-a-Photo-with-a-Blurred-Background-on-Older-iPhones-by-Getting-Closer-to-the-Subject"><a href="#Part-2-Take-a-Photo-with-a-Blurred-Background-on-Older-iPhones-by-Getting-Closer-to-the-Subject" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Take a Photo with a Blurred Background on Older iPhones by Getting Closer to the Subject"></a>Part 2: Take a Photo with a Blurred Background on Older iPhones by Getting Closer to the Subject</h2><p>If you are using an older model of iPhone that doesn’t have ‘Portrait’ mode, you can still capture the images with the blurred background by getting closer to the subject, and enabling ‘Auto Focus’ before tapping the ‘Capture’ button. You can learn how to do this by following the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Camera App</strong></p><p>Use the method explained above to launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone. Because it’s an old model that doesn’t have Portrait mode, you can stay in the <strong>PHOTO</strong> mode.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Turn on Auto Focus</strong></p><p>Tap and hold the main subject on the screen until the <strong>AE&#x2F;AF Lock</strong> message shows up at the top to confirm that the <strong>Auto Focus</strong> feature has been turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-auto-focus-blur-photo-background.jpg"                      alt="iphone auto focus blur photo background"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Capture and Access the Image</strong></p><p>Get closer to the subject. Ensure that the background around the main subject gets blurry and you move forward. Tap the <strong>Capture</strong> icon once you are close enough to get the desired level of blurriness in the background. Now, use the method explained above to access the captured photo.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Adding-Vignette-Effect-to-Photo-to-Blur-the-Background-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Adding-Vignette-Effect-to-Photo-to-Blur-the-Background-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Adding Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background on iPhone"></a>Part 3: Adding Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background on iPhone</h2><p>The built-in Photos app comes with the Vignette effect that can be applied to the image at the time of editing. However, to get this done, it is recommended that the main subject should be at the center so the background looks unimportant. You can follow the steps given below to learn <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong> with the Vignette effect:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Photo’s Edit Mode</strong></p><p>Launch the <strong>Photos</strong> app on your iPhone, go to the album with the target photo, and tap to open the target photo. Next, make sure that the picture is not open in the full-screen mode, and tap <strong>Edit</strong> from the top-right corner to get to the <strong>Edit</strong> mode.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Apply and Adjust the Vignette Effect</strong></p><p>Tap the Effects icon from the bottom, swipe left to horizontally scroll through the available effects to get to <strong>VIGNETTE</strong>, and use the slider under it to manage the intensity to <strong>blur picture iPhone</strong> has.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-picture-on-iphone-with-vignette-effect.jpg"                      alt="blur picture on iphone with vignette effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Save and Access the Photo</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>Done</strong> from the bottom-right corner to save the changes and to exit the <strong>Edit</strong> mode. Continue using the image as and&#x2F;or where needed.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Blur-the-Background-of-Photos-on-iPhone-with-Apps"><a href="#Part-4-Blur-the-Background-of-Photos-on-iPhone-with-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps"></a>Part 4: Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps</h2><p>You may want to use a third-party app to apply effects to the photos because they offer several advanced features that the iPhone’s built-in Photos app doesn’t. Furthermore, since such programs are designed specifically for the purpose, they are quite intuitive and come with self-explanatory options and buttons.</p><p>There is a plethora of apps available on the App Store that can help you get the job done, and most of them come with their free tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur photos on iPhone</strong>. One such program is Snapseed that offers an easy way to pick the main subject in the image, and blur all the background objects behind it. The process of blurring the picture with Snapseed is given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Add the Target Photo to Snapseed</strong></p><p>After <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619" >installing Snapseed from the App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, launch the program, and tap anywhere on the main screen. On the accessibility allowance box, tap <strong>Select Photos</strong>, tap to select the target photo from your iPhone, and tap <strong>Done</strong> from the top-right corner. Next, tap anywhere on the screen to import the selected picture to Snapseed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-photo-to-blur-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="open photo to blur snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Pick the Blur Tool</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>TOOLS</strong> from the bottom of the interface, and from the options available in the box that pops up, tap <strong>Lens Blur</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pick-blur-tool-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="pick blur tool snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Adjust the Blur Shape and Size</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Shape</strong> icon from the bottom to switch between the <strong>Linear</strong> and <strong>Elliptical</strong> blur shapes. Tap the Blue dot at the center of the image, and drag it to the main subject in the photo. Next, use two fingers to drag inwards or outwards on the screen to decrease or increase the effective area respectively.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Blur the Photo and Export</strong></p><p>From the top, ensure that the <strong>Blur Strength</strong> option is selected, tap anywhere on the screen, and drag to the right to increase the intensity of the blurriness. Optionally, you can tap the Effect Types icon from the bottom, and tap to choose <strong>Vignette Strength</strong> from the box that comes up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapseed-blur-photo-background.jpg"                      alt="snapseed blur photo background"                ></p><p>Then, as earlier, drag your finger to the right or left anywhere on the screen to increase or decrease the intensity of the effect respectively. Once done, tap the <strong>OK</strong> button (with the tick mark) from the bottom-right corner. Back on the main screen, tap <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right, you tap your preferred option for exporting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-blurred-photo-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="save blurred photo snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Blurring the background in a photo ensures that the main subject remains in the focus, and all the other unimportant objects don’t steal the limelight. If you are using iPhone 7 Plus or above models, the background of the photos can be blurred at the time of capturing. Furthermore, the built-in Photos app in iPhones also come with the Vignette effect that enables you to do the job with ease. However, if you want precision and more control over the images while blurring, you can use an efficient third-party tool like Snapseed that also has its own set of tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong>.</p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Take a Photo with a Blurred Background</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Add Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone"></a>Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone</h2><p>Portrait mode in the Camera app is available on iPhone 7 Plus and above models.

Next, tap anywhere on the screen to import the selected picture to Snapseed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-photo-to-blur-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="open photo to blur snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Pick the Blur Tool</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>TOOLS</strong> from the bottom of the interface, and from the options available in the box that pops up, tap <strong>Lens Blur</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pick-blur-tool-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="pick blur tool snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Adjust the Blur Shape and Size</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Shape</strong> icon from the bottom to switch between the <strong>Linear</strong> and <strong>Elliptical</strong> blur shapes. Tap the Blue dot at the center of the image, and drag it to the main subject in the photo. Next, use two fingers to drag inwards or outwards on the screen to decrease or increase the effective area respectively.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Blur the Photo and Export</strong></p><p>From the top, ensure that the <strong>Blur Strength</strong> option is selected, tap anywhere on the screen, and drag to the right to increase the intensity of the blurriness. Optionally, you can tap the Effect Types icon from the bottom, and tap to choose <strong>Vignette Strength</strong> from the box that comes up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapseed-blur-photo-background.jpg"                      alt="snapseed blur photo background"                ></p><p>Then, as earlier, drag your finger to the right or left anywhere on the screen to increase or decrease the intensity of the effect respectively. Once done, tap the <strong>OK</strong> button (with the tick mark) from the bottom-right corner. Back on the main screen, tap <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right, you tap your preferred option for exporting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-blurred-photo-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="save blurred photo snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Blurring the background in a photo ensures that the main subject remains in the focus, and all the other unimportant objects don’t steal the limelight. If you are using iPhone 7 Plus or above models, the background of the photos can be blurred at the time of capturing. Furthermore, the built-in Photos app in iPhones also come with the Vignette effect that enables you to do the job with ease. However, if you want precision and more control over the images while blurring, you can use an efficient third-party tool like Snapseed that also has its own set of tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong>.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"

Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. The regular SSD or hard drive can no longer suffice with the quantity of data that needs to be stored, so the only option is to subscribe to a possible cloud storage service. The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.</p><p>We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler. If you want to save money on storage, <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> is essential when choosing the best cloud storage service provider.</p><p>So, read on as we discuss <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> below:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison"><a href="#Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison"></a>Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison</h2><p>Here is a table comparing top cloud storage providers’ free storage space and their <strong>cloud storage pricing comparison</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cloud Storage Providers</th><th>Free Storage</th><th>Monthly Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iCloud</td><td>5GB</td><td>50GB - $1200GB - $32TB - $10</td></tr><tr><td>Google Drive</td><td>15GB</td><td>100GB - $7.49250GB - $10500GB - $18.95</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB - $21TB - $72TB - $12</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB of storage for $2 per month or $20 annually</td></tr><tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>2GB</td><td>Plus: 2TB - $10Family: 2TB - $17.</td></tr><tr><td>pCloud</td><td>10GB</td><td>500GB - $50 a year2TB - $100 a year10TB - Custom</td></tr><tr><td>Sync.com</td><td>5GB</td><td>1TB - $6Unlimited - $15</td></tr><tr><td>Icedrive</td><td>10GB</td><td>150GB - $1.671TB - $4.175TB - $15</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, Google Drive and Photos are already fine if you don’t wish to invest much money. For example, you can use Google Photos to store photos in the cloud.</p><p>The security and privacy of cloud services are crucial, correct storage capacity and device compatibility.</p><p>If security is your top priority, choose Sync.com, IceDrive, and pCloud.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-Browsing-with-FFXP"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-Browsing-with-FFXP" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your Browsing with FFXP"></a>How to Optimize Your Browsing with FFXP</h2><p>Using your PC to watch films while working on something else has recently been possible due to the new picture-in-picture mode function. Mozilla Firefox users may utilize this functionality to accomplish two or more things simultaneously.</p><p>This feature is an important tool to help you multitask by dragging videos from web pages and navigating to another tab so you can continue working on other tabs while the video keeps playing. In this article, you will understand everything about this feature and how to enable this feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-1.jpg"                      alt="the firefox"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Picture-in-Picture-Mode-Works"><a href="#Part-1-How-Picture-in-Picture-Mode-Works" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Picture-in-Picture Mode Works"></a>Part 1. How Picture-in-Picture Mode Works</h2><p>Picture-in-Picture allows for simple tab navigation without interfering with the video you are viewing. Enabling this feature allows your videos to play in a tiny overlay utilizing a separate video player. Users may move, resize and even pin the player on the screen. You may even switch between tabs without interfering with video playing.</p><p>The interface has a play&#x2F;pause button. You may also recover a video by locating it as well as close the interface by clicking the close button if you wish to. It will return to the initial tab and continue from where it left off when the player was closed.</p><p>When your video is in picture-in-picture mode, the video placeholder also displays on the website. “This video is playing in Picture-in-Picture mode,” it reads.</p><p>Using keyboard shortcuts, you can make adjustments for loudness but not for the video quality. However, you may make these adjustments from the original web page of the film. Also, keep in mind that any modifications to its initial position will affect the floating player. The video will immediately disappear when you refresh or open a new website in that tab.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-activate-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-activate-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to activate Picture-in-Picture (PiP) in Firefox"></a>Part 2. How to activate Picture-in-Picture (PiP) in Firefox</h2><p>Firefox is often considered one of the most data-protective browsers, but that is not all. Mozilla Firefox also comes with a variety of useful tools and features. It even incorporates certain features you can only find through extensions in other browsers.</p><p>Firefox, like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other current browsers, supports picture-in-picture mode. This functionality allows you to view movies in a floating window while working with other tabs, browsers, desktop apps, and so on.</p><p>Because this picture-in-picture panel is an overlay, you may move it to any part of your screen. So, in picture-in-picture mode, you may click play&#x2F;pause, shut it, or expand it to its full size.</p><h3 id="Step-by-step-Guide-to-Enable-Firefox-Picture-in-Picture-Mode"><a href="#Step-by-step-Guide-to-Enable-Firefox-Picture-in-Picture-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Step-by-step Guide to Enable Firefox Picture-in-Picture Mode"></a>Step-by-step Guide to Enable Firefox Picture-in-Picture Mode</h3><p>Without the assistance of third-party add-on modules, PiP mode is a feasible choice. The picture-in-picture (PiP) mode option in the Firefox browser is activated by default. However, if this does not work, you can easily re-enable the option in the Firefox browser’s Settings area.</p><p>Here’s how to activate picture-in-picture video control in Firefox**:**</p><ol><li><strong>To start</strong>, locate and open the Firefox browser on your PC.</li><li>Click on the 3 horizontal lines in the top-right menu.</li><li>Choose the <strong>Options&#x2F;Settings</strong> from the menu list. This opens the settings mode and its general model.</li></ol><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-2.jpg" alt="choose the options/settings"></p><ol><li>Scroll down in the General mode to locate the <strong>Browsing</strong> settings option.</li><li>Here, you will see a list of browsing settings; click to select the ‘<strong>Enable picture in picture video controls’</strong>, and check the box.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-3.jpg"                      alt="a list of browsing settings"                ></p><p>Following the above procedure, you may now see the Firefox Picture-in-Picture symbol in the video streaming player. Whenever you visit a streaming site, a symbol for pip mode appears as an overlay on the video screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-4.jpg"                      alt="the firefox picture in picture symbol"                ></p><p>You can load only a single video using the above guideline. Suppose you want to lunch multiple videos to increase your multitasking experience. In that case, follow the outlined procedure:</p><ol><li>Open any website with video in Firefox web browser.</li><li>When the video start. Move the cursor over the video to reveal the Picture-in-Picture logo.</li><li>Picture-in-Picture mode is activated by tapping the logo. The video is repositioned to the side of the web page.</li><li>Repeat the preceding steps on the same page or in a separate tab to open several movies.</li><li>Firefox plays the new video above the first. Drag and drop it anywhere to display both.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-5.jpg"                      alt="the new video above the first"                ></p><p>By following these steps, videos appear on the screen at the same time. For all tabs containing open videos, the main Firefox window shows a “play” symbol. Even if you dismiss Firefox, numerous videos will continue to play in other programs or on your desktop.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Disable-the-Picture-in-Picture-Mode"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Disable-the-Picture-in-Picture-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Disable the Picture-in-Picture Mode"></a>Part 3. How to Disable the Picture-in-Picture Mode</h2><p>Sometimes, the PiP mode can disturb necessary research or task that needs your full concentration.

If you want to turn off Picture-in-Picture mode and return to the video tab, hover over the video, then click the following icon <strong>“X”</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-6.jpg"                      alt="click the following icon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-tips-about-Picture-in-Picture-Mode-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-4-Other-tips-about-Picture-in-Picture-Mode-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.
