The editor also offers a one-click speech-to-text feature, and you can change your font style and color or apply animations.

Step2 In the next step, drag and drop your video to the **timeline** and click the **"Play"** icon to listen to the voiceover on the footage. Now, press the **"M"** key to add a marker.

Now, select the **"Titles"** option from the toolbar and open the **"Subtitles"** tab. **Double-click** the subtitle you want to download and preview it.

Step3 Drag and drop the subtitle template to the timeline and adjust it on your video along with the marker point. In the timeline, double-click the **subtitle template,** type the text from the video voiceover, or use the text-to-speech option to add the content.

You can also make your video clip more vibrant by adding color or templates and adjusting the text spacing!

Yay! You did it! After deleting the preset text, go to the **"Animation"** tab and apply any animation effect you want. When you're done, click **"OK."** Finally, repeat these steps for the rest of the video to add the subtitles.
