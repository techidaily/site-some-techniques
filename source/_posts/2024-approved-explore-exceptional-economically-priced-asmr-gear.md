Although very costly, this microphone holds several incredible features that make it worth your investment. Sennheiser MKH416 has a built-in laser beam focus- a feature that lets the mic capture only your voice and rejects every other ambient sound. Connecting Sennheiser to an audio recording source requires an XLR cable and a phantom power source. This voice aid offers great services.
