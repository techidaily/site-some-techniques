This game is about the journey inside yourself. Through your way, you will find lanterns floating in the air. You have to reach to those lanterns quickly since they will guide you through the drawback of your memories. There are 10 levels in this game and you will have to fight with the gravity as well since this will pull you down the holes. So, be very careful!

## Spirit Journey

 If you are not fond of violating or shooting games and want a peaceful and soothing experience while playing, then Spirit Journey is just the right choice for you.

You have to reach to those lanterns quickly since they will guide you through the drawback of your memories.

 In the changing world of technology, one of the most exciting invention of the present time is the VR gaming. This new technology has completely changed the way games used to be played. You will be all in all in such gaming. A wide variety of genre is available. Here I am going to tell you about the top 5 Samsung Gear VR games that you should try. Below is a table of overview of the games.

 Below here is a brief of each of the game stated in the table.

## Sky fighter

 Sky fighter training day is a free mission of the sky fighters. The context of the game is earth in near future. This is a practice mission. Basically in this game, you will learn the four basis systems of Sky Fighter armor equipped. You need to learn to use propulsion, protection, stabilization and shooting. You need to follow the instructions of the instructor Lt. Rita Velasco. Sky Fighter is a sophisticated armor that is equipped with powerful combats. You need to successfully complete your training without destroying your armor.

 However, if you want to get extra missions, you can get that by buying missions. It is easy but will cost you money. The game has been released on 9th June this year and so far received a mixed reaction. It is suitable for everyone.

## Spirit Journey

 If you are not fond of violating or shooting games and want a peaceful and soothing experience while playing, then Spirit Journey is just the right choice for you. This game is about the journey inside yourself. Through your way, you will find lanterns floating in the air. You have to reach to those lanterns quickly since they will guide you through the drawback of your memories. There are 10 levels in this game and you will have to fight with the gravity as well since this will pull you down the holes. So, be very careful!

 This is a complete non-violent game, requires BT controller or touchpad to play. Indago is the developer of this game and it has been released on 17th of August.

## Dark Days

 Before talking about the game let’s have a look at what some others have to say about it.

_"Dark Days is probably the most visually complete game on the Gear VR"_ –MobileVRDaily

_"Dark Days does a lot of things right and provides an interesting world full of thrills and mystery to keep you uncovering secrets until the end"_ –UploadVR

 This is one of the smartest and most thrilling VR games so far. The team of White Night has created this game and this time you are about to going through a haunting experience altogether. The mission of this game is to find out what is going on in a creepy motel and its surrounding area by solving a number of puzzles. But be very careful with your steps because someone is near you watching all your moves. The players will experience a world of supernatural stuffs.

 The response is extremely positive and the game has already become quite famous among the VR users.

## Motivator

 This is another very exciting shooting game plotted in the year 2044\. During this time people tend to lose their spirit because of an unknown virus attack named lethargy. The virus soon goes out of control and in such a situation the International Disease Research Center creates a nanomachine that can attack the virus at its source.

 The name of the machine is Motivator that can restore the spirit in the mankind. The success of the mission solely depends on the piloting skill of yours. This is an action game and is already gaining popularity. Blue Print Inc. is the developer of this game. A truly skilled pilot is very much in demand. If you think you have that ability, then save the mankind with your skills.

## Shooting Showdown 2

This groundbreaking ultra-competitive game will take you through the world of ultimate shooting experience. You will love the thrill and excitement. And this is the world’s first game with in-the-face VR support. This means, you don’t need to aim an object. All you need to do is to move your head to aim an object and then tap the touchpad.
