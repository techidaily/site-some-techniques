![syma x5c camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/syma-x5c-camera.jpg)

 Syma H5C camera is rated as moderately stable and it is capable enough to take impressive pictures from air. This device is equipped with a 2GB MicroSD card that offers personal storage space to all recorded videos and images. The sad part is here that controller unit of this device is able to send signals to drone only; it cannot control the camera actions. Thus your camera stays focused in only one direction all the time and have fixed focus during shoots. You cannot apply zoom, direction sensing inputs or focus adjustment controls when your device is in air. If you are searching for a highly controlled footage generator then it is good to go for other Phantom series and other competing models as per your budget. But Syma H5C is really a good choice to start with.

The outer edge possesses a highly flexible yet durable plastic guard cage.

#### 3\.  Battery Life

 The average recorded flight time of this unit is about 6 to 10 minutes that is powered from 500mAh batteries with 3.7Volt rating. This high quality battery can hold charge perfectly but you need to spend about 100 minutes for recharging of drone batteries. This quad possesses only one battery in the package but if you want to enjoy more flights then you can prefer to buy spare batteries.

#### 4\.  Flight Performance

 This device possesses regular flight mode as default mode so users need not to make much efforts for its flight arrangements. Beginners are always suggested to spend some time for learning control mechanisms and the major capabilities of drone so that a safe flight can be taken. Regular mode offers easier and safe flight so that beginners can feel comfortable about its controls. Further the expert mode can be activated from push button switch.

In this expert mode, users can enjoy flipping operations and other advanced controls.

#### 5. Control Range

The maximum flying range falls between 30 to 50 meters and no lags have been reported yet in control selection and quadcopter reactions. Using flip switch, you can directly adjust the movements in air.

#### 6\.  Camera

![syma x5c camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/syma-x5c-camera.jpg)

 Syma H5C camera is rated as moderately stable and it is capable enough to take impressive pictures from air. This device is equipped with a 2GB MicroSD card that offers personal storage space to all recorded videos and images. The sad part is here that controller unit of this device is able to send signals to drone only; it cannot control the camera actions. Thus your camera stays focused in only one direction all the time and have fixed focus during shoots. You cannot apply zoom, direction sensing inputs or focus adjustment controls when your device is in air. If you are searching for a highly controlled footage generator then it is good to go for other Phantom series and other competing models as per your budget. But Syma H5C is really a good choice to start with.

## Conclusion

 Syma's X5C can be included in the list of must buy product for beginners due to its all incredible features. If you are a beginner and are just going to learn about flight basics then this advanced camera unit can serve you best with all impressive controls.
