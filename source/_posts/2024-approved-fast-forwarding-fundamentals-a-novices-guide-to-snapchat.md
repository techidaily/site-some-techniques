## Part 1: How to Speed Up Videos on Snapchat?

In Snapchat, **the process of how do you speed up a video on Snapchat** depends on the filters available. The Speed Modifier filter options have high-quality speed-changing functions, including the Speed Up option. This filter improves the recorded video speed when you apply it, and even the audio pitch changes accordingly.

Specifically, the speed-up feature appears with a hare (jumping or sprinting) icon and a fast-forward icon. Remember that you can use this filter type on recorded Snapchat videos only and not while recording.

**A step-by-step breakdown of how to speed up Snapchat videos:**

Step1 Download the Snapchat app and launch it on your iPhone or Android smartphone. Sign into the app using your credentials.

Step2 Tap and hold your finger on the Capture button. This will record the video. Keep your hold on the button until the recording is complete, and then release it.

Step3 On your screen, swipe in the right direction until you see the Rabbit icon. In the matter of **how to speed up a video on snap,** this is the one that represents speed increase motion.

Step4 See the preview of the video you clicked at a higher speed. If satisfied, click on the Save button or Next to share it with other contacts.

## Part 2: Other Features for Speed Adjustment on Snapchat

**How to reverse videos on Snapchat?**

Step1 Launch your Snapchat app on your phone.

Step2 Hold your finger down on the Record button to record your video. Then, release it if you are done and the video will develop. You can add other editing elements like text, stickers, etc.

Step3 On the screen, swipe left. Multiple visual filter options will appear. Keep swiping on them until you see the fifth filter (granted, you have 4 visual filters). The motion filters will appear next.

Step4 Swipe until you reach the icon with three reverse arrows. You typically have to swipe 7 times in total to reach this option. The video will play in Reverse in the preview.

Step2 Press the Capture button and record the video you need. Keep your hold on the button and release it after you are done recording.

Step3 Swipe on the screen to the right. Keep swiping until you reach the slide with a Rabbit image on the screen. It signified the motion filters.
