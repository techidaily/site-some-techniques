## Frequently Asked Questions About Blur Photos in Photoshop

#### What Options Do I Have When Using Photoshop to Blur Images?

The Blur Gallery offers five options for those who want to blur images. They are:

• Path-Blur: This option allows you to draw a specific path that the blur will follow. Path-Blur gives you the motion illusion in a still photo.

• Tilt-Shift Blur: This option mimics the style of tilt-shift cameras by blurring out the bottom and top of your image. Most people use it to create fake miniature scenes. Tilt-Shift Blur allows you to adjust the strength and size of the blurred areas, and you can rotate them.

• Iris Blur: This option allows you to choose a circle to remain in focus while the rest of the image remains blurred. You can also adjust the size and shape of the circles and adjust the blur's strength.

• Field Blur: If you want to blur the background of your image, this is the ideal option. When you first choose the Field Blur, it will put a pin where the blur effect will happen. You can add another pin and adjust the strength of the blur to zero. Keep in mind that objects within the radius of your second pin will be in focus, while objects that are within the radius of your first pin will be blurred.

#### How Can I Fix Blurry Images in Photoshop?

You can fix blurry images in Photoshop, especially when there's motion blur. But, this raster graphics editor cannot recover out-of-focus images effectively and still keep their natural look: it will create loads of digital artifacts.

You'll find the tools to make your blurry images in Filters > Sharpen. You can use the Smart Sharpen and Shake Reduction options to make your images less blurry.

#### Can I Blur Images in Photoshop Using the Brush?

Yes. You can soften areas of your image and make viewers focus on your subject by using your favorite brush to apply the blur effect. You only need to select the Blur tool and choose a brush strength and tip; you can then drag it over the areas you would like to blur.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Blur Photos in Photoshop

#### What Options Do I Have When Using Photoshop to Blur Images?

The Blur Gallery offers five options for those who want to blur images. They are:

• Path-Blur: This option allows you to draw a specific path that the blur will follow. Path-Blur gives you the motion illusion in a still photo.

• Tilt-Shift Blur: This option mimics the style of tilt-shift cameras by blurring out the bottom and top of your image. Most people use it to create fake miniature scenes. Tilt-Shift Blur allows you to adjust the strength and size of the blurred areas, and you can rotate them.

• Iris Blur: This option allows you to choose a circle to remain in focus while the rest of the image remains blurred. You can also adjust the size and shape of the circles and adjust the blur's strength.

• Field Blur: If you want to blur the background of your image, this is the ideal option. When you first choose the Field Blur, it will put a pin where the blur effect will happen. You can add another pin and adjust the strength of the blur to zero. Keep in mind that objects within the radius of your second pin will be in focus, while objects that are within the radius of your first pin will be blurred.

#### How Can I Fix Blurry Images in Photoshop?

You can fix blurry images in Photoshop, especially when there's motion blur. But, this raster graphics editor cannot recover out-of-focus images effectively and still keep their natural look: it will create loads of digital artifacts.

You'll find the tools to make your blurry images in Filters > Sharpen. You can use the Smart Sharpen and Shake Reduction options to make your images less blurry.

#### Can I Blur Images in Photoshop Using the Brush?

Yes. You can soften areas of your image and make viewers focus on your subject by using your favorite brush to apply the blur effect. You only need to select the Blur tool and choose a brush strength and tip; you can then drag it over the areas you would like to blur.
