![Canon EOS Rebel 2000](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/canon-eos-rebel-2000-35mm-film-camera.jpg)

 The Canon EOS Rebel 2000 is a [35mm film](https://filmschoolonline.com/sample%5Flessons/sample%5Flesson%5FHD%5Fvs%5F35mm.htm) that makes one of the best film cameras for beginners. It comes with autofocus but full manual controls, should you need it. This touch lets you learn both ways should you want to. Itâ€™s also good for those who have a basic film camera knowledge, but that want to advance it.

 The Canon is arguably the best 35mm film camera for beginners because it also has a built-in 35-zone exposure system. This leads to less correction of your shot. As a bonus, it comes with 11 shooting modes, 7 stages of autofocus, and high-speed sync modes for faster uploading. All for such a great price, too.

**Pros of the Canon Rebel:**

* Fully automatic, built-in and retractable flash, super quiet running.
* High-speed sync, FE Lock, EX-series Speedlites and advanced flash metering.

**Cons of the Canon Rebel:**

* Not the best performance in low lighting situations, but thatâ€™s not the cameraâ€™s fault. Step one of filmography is making sure the lighting is good.

The camera uses a pentaprism fixed viewer for more than 90% accuracy and reflection of what the picture captures, which is high for any camera. As a bonus feature, it has a stopped-down meter needle and aperture scale for the viewing info. Itâ€™s the top class.

## Part 1: The Best Film Cameras for Beginners

 So what are these miraculous cameras? Letâ€™s find out what the best starter film camera is for you.

### 1. [Canon EOS Rebel 2000 35mm Film SLR Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Rebel-2000-Camera-28-80mm/dp/B00001QEMF/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?keywords=film%2Bcamera%2Bfor%2Bbeginners&qid=1583402467&sr=8-1&th=1"")

![Canon EOS Rebel 2000](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/canon-eos-rebel-2000-35mm-film-camera.jpg)

 The Canon EOS Rebel 2000 is a [35mm film](https://filmschoolonline.com/sample%5Flessons/sample%5Flesson%5FHD%5Fvs%5F35mm.htm) that makes one of the best film cameras for beginners. It comes with autofocus but full manual controls, should you need it. This touch lets you learn both ways should you want to. Itâ€™s also good for those who have a basic film camera knowledge, but that want to advance it.

 The Canon is arguably the best 35mm film camera for beginners because it also has a built-in 35-zone exposure system. This leads to less correction of your shot. As a bonus, it comes with 11 shooting modes, 7 stages of autofocus, and high-speed sync modes for faster uploading. All for such a great price, too.

**Pros of the Canon Rebel:**

* Fully automatic, built-in and retractable flash, super quiet running.
* High-speed sync, FE Lock, EX-series Speedlites and advanced flash metering.

**Cons of the Canon Rebel:**

* Not the best performance in low lighting situations, but thatâ€™s not the cameraâ€™s fault. Step one of filmography is making sure the lighting is good.

The camera uses a pentaprism fixed viewer for more than 90% accuracy and reflection of what the picture captures, which is high for any camera. As a bonus feature, it has a stopped-down meter needle and aperture scale for the viewing info. Itâ€™s the top class.

**Pros of the Canon AE**

* You wonâ€™t need a replacement. Perhaps ever.
* Reviewers compliment the light meter, shutter speeds, and photography class. One reviewer used the term work of art.

**Cons of the Canon AE**
