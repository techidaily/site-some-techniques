### 5\. Add Double Exposure

This technique is usually applied to merge two layers and exposures on a single image.

### 8\. Explore Borders and Stickers

What makes images exciting and inviting? Borders and funny stickers can help to enhance your images effortlessly.

For instance, for a filmy and dramatic look, you can apply filters like dirt, cornered, film, etc. Whereas for a soft touch, you can add borders like clean, black, flowery, and ground.

### 9\. Add Effects and Overlays
