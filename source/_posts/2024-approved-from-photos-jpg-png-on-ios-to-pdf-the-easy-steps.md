We often take photos of train tickets, restaurant bills and all other sorts of documents during the course of the busy business day, but iPhones and iPads save them as JPEG files instead of PDF. There is no reason to worry because both iPhones an iPads provide a lot of different tools that will allow you to convert JPEG or PNG files into PDFs.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to effortlessly turn your images into PDF files in just a few simple steps that don't require you to be a skillful photo editor.

## How to Convert JPG/PNG Image to PDF on an iPhone

iPhones, iPads or iPods all offer a feature many people don't know about that lets you convert image files into the PDF format.

* [Method 1: Convert Photos to PDF with Apple’s Photos app](#part1)
* [Method 2: Use Photo to PDF Converter Apps for iPhone](#part2)

### Method 1: Convert Photos to PDF with Apple’s Photos app

Before we proceed any further, it is important to note that you must have an iOS 9.0 or some more recent version of the iOS system installed on your device in order to be able to convert pictures to PDF with the Photos app. Launch the Photos app and tap on the Select button to choose which images you want to include in your PDF file.

In the next step, you should click on the Share icon and then select the Print option from the menu. You can use the 3D Touch to press a page thumbnail or zoom in on the preview thumbnail if your device doesn't have a 3D touch to create a PDF.
