## From Sound to Sight: Choosing Between Audio and Video Media

When choosing which media to use, there are a few different options. In the battle of podcast vs. YouTube, which one would you pick? One or both? You may upload videos on YouTube or create podcasts.

One reason to use Spotify for podcasts is that it's a global platform, meaning your podcast can be heard by a large audience worldwide.

Spotify is a popular platform, so listeners will likely discover your podcast through them. Putting out a video on YouTube is more work than creating a podcast; however, it may be rewarding. Read and find which one is the best!

## A Brief Overview of Podcast vs. YouTube

There's no denying that YouTube is one of the most popular online platforms. Millions of people use it daily to watch videos on everything from current events to how-to guides.

But YouTube isn't the only game in town regarding online video.

Podcasts are also becoming increasingly popular, especially among people who commute or have long car journeys. So, which is better - YouTube or podcasts?

There's a massive range of content available on YouTube. No matter your interests, you're sure to find something to watch. YouTube videos are usually shorter than podcasts, so they're perfect for busy people who don't have time to commit to an extended episode.

You can watch YouTube videos on your phone or tablet, even if you're not connected to the internet. So it is perfect for when you're on the go. Now talking about podcasts, they can be downloaded and listened to offline, so you can listen even if you're not connected to the internet.

The difference between podcasts and YouTube is that Podcasts are usually longer than YouTube videos. So they can be great for getting in-depth information on a topic. In addition, you may listen to podcasts while doing other things, such as driving or cooking.

Lately, investing your time in creating a meaningful video podcast makes more sense. The editing process of a podcast will be simpler than editing a YouTube video. You'll only have to focus on audio when working on the podcast.

On the other hand, YouTube will require more attention to detail while working on the video, audio, subtitle, and description. Some may simultaneously work on videos and podcasts, creating content for both platforms. Many creators upload videos on YouTube and convert them into podcasts.

## What Is the Difference Between Podcasts and YouTube?

Podcasts and YouTube are popular audio/video platforms for uploading and consuming content. However, they both have their unique benefits and drawbacks. Here's a quick rundown of the critical differences between podcasts and YouTube.

You'll need a steady internet connection and time to watch a YouTube video. Podcasts are more convenient to listen to while doing other things, such as commuting or working out.

![funny kids videos on youtube can get millions of views](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-1.jpg)

On the downside, podcasts generally don't have the same production value as YouTube videos, so they can sometimes feel "cheap" or "amateurish." On the other hand, YouTube videos usually have better production value than podcasts due to content creators' higher level of investment.

![apple has launched podcasts in competition with spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-2.jpg)

YouTube also offers a more diverse range of content than podcasts since anyone can upload a video. However, YouTube videos can be much more explanatory than podcasts, making them less convenient to consume.

## Podcast vs. YouTube: What Are the Current Industry Trends

The current industry trends for podcasts vs. YouTube are different. To know which is better, podcast or YouTube, you may have to learn about the statistics. Podcasts are seeing a resurgence in popularity, while YouTube is still the top video site in the world. About 383.7 million podcast listeners globally as of November 2022.

Out of these podcast listeners, 50% are between 12-34 in age, and 43% are between 35-54 in age. In Canada, 1 in 3 people listens to a podcast. The country recorded the highest viewership in the world in 2022\. Australian and US podcast listeners are at the top in 2022.

This number is at 2.1 billion monthly active users for YouTube based all around the world. The global audience of 95% of YouTube viewers is adults between 18 and 29.

Talking about ads, 80% of podcast listeners believe product ads in a podcast lead to purchase. YouTube also has massive ad growth of 5% ad revenue growth to $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022.

## Opportunities & Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube

There are many opportunities and challenges for creating podcasts and YouTube videos. Podcasts can be a great way to share your knowledge and stories with others while also building an audience.

However, making an exciting podcast is tricky, and creating a good one takes time and effort. One of the biggest challenges is finding a good topic. In addition, you need to be passionate about what you're talking about if you want your podcast to be successful.

Another challenge is finding the right audio or video equipment. If you don't have the right tools, your podcast will sound poor, and your videos will look amateurish. In addition, many podcasters and YouTubers may struggle to edit videos initially. As a result, people don't spend much time on their channels.

There are also many opportunities for making money from podcasts and YouTube videos. For example, you can sell advertising space, sell merchandise, or get sponsorships. Furthermore, you may get famous and get invited to events.

## Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content

When it comes to deciding how to share your content on podcast vs. YouTube, there are a few things you'll want to consider.

1. **What's the goal?** The first thing you'll want to determine is the goal of sharing your content. Are you looking to build an audience for your podcast or video channel, generate leads for your business, or simply leave a meaningful legacy behind?
2. The second factor you'll want to consider is **your audience size and engagement**. How many people will actually listen to or watch your content? And how engaged are they with it? Do they regularly share it on social media or respond positively to reviews?
3. **What format should your content be in?** For example, should it be an audio-only podcast, a video-only channel, or a mixture of both? And what style should it be in – formal or informal?
4. **You'll need to ensure that your content is creative and innovative.** Is something unique about your topic that will make it stand out from the crowd? Or do you have new ideas that could be valuable for others to learn about?
5. **Pick the right niche.** For example, a cooking show may not work well as a podcast, but it could be great as a YouTube series.
6. **You'll want to promote your content in the appropriate channels.** If you're creating a YouTube series based on your podcast, promote it on your podcast platform and your YouTube channel.
7. **Focus on building skills.** If your current skill level is at a beginner level, you may do well making less complex videos and podcasts. Using tools such as Filmora may help you create and edit videos.
8. **How you create and promote content may also depend on your budget.** So be mindful of your budget and expand when you receive the proper engagement.

## Final Words

So, which is excellent in the battle of podcast vs. YouTube video? That depends on your personal preferences. If you'd like to create in-depth, topic-focused content, podcasts are probably a better choice.

If you prefer to create playful and exciting content, then vlogs might be more your thing. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide which format you prefer. You may start with the easier one and learn how to create both podcasts and YouTube videos simultaneously.

### Monetization

You can monetize your YouTube videos and podcast episodes in a few different ways. One way is to use Google AdSense. With AdSense, you can place ad units on your videos and earn money based on the traffic your videos generate.

Another way to monetize your content is by selling products or services through videos and podcasts. For example, you can use a platform like Gumroad to sell digital products or a service like Patreon to sell memberships or access exclusive content.

You can also use your YouTube channel and podcast to drive your website or blog traffic. You can then monetize your website or blog through advertising, affiliate marketing, or selling products and services.

Whatever approach you take, make sure that you are providing value to your audience. For example, if your videos and podcasts are helpful and informative, people will be more likely to watch and listen, and you'll be more likely to monetize your content successfully.

## Podcast vs. YouTube: What Are the Current Industry Trends

The current industry trends for podcasts vs. YouTube are different. To know which is better, podcast or YouTube, you may have to learn about the statistics. Podcasts are seeing a resurgence in popularity, while YouTube is still the top video site in the world. About 383.7 million podcast listeners globally as of November 2022.

Out of these podcast listeners, 50% are between 12-34 in age, and 43% are between 35-54 in age. In Canada, 1 in 3 people listens to a podcast. The country recorded the highest viewership in the world in 2022\. Australian and US podcast listeners are at the top in 2022.

This number is at 2.1 billion monthly active users for YouTube based all around the world. The global audience of 95% of YouTube viewers is adults between 18 and 29.

Talking about ads, 80% of podcast listeners believe product ads in a podcast lead to purchase. YouTube also has massive ad growth of 5% ad revenue growth to $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022.

## Opportunities & Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube

There are many opportunities and challenges for creating podcasts and YouTube videos. Podcasts can be a great way to share your knowledge and stories with others while also building an audience.

However, making an exciting podcast is tricky, and creating a good one takes time and effort. One of the biggest challenges is finding a good topic. In addition, you need to be passionate about what you're talking about if you want your podcast to be successful.

Another challenge is finding the right audio or video equipment. If you don't have the right tools, your podcast will sound poor, and your videos will look amateurish. In addition, many podcasters and YouTubers may struggle to edit videos initially. As a result, people don't spend much time on their channels.

There are also many opportunities for making money from podcasts and YouTube videos. For example, you can sell advertising space, sell merchandise, or get sponsorships. Furthermore, you may get famous and get invited to events.

## Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content

When it comes to deciding how to share your content on podcast vs. YouTube, there are a few things you'll want to consider.

1. **What's the goal?** The first thing you'll want to determine is the goal of sharing your content. Are you looking to build an audience for your podcast or video channel, generate leads for your business, or simply leave a meaningful legacy behind?
2. The second factor you'll want to consider is **your audience size and engagement**. How many people will actually listen to or watch your content? And how engaged are they with it? Do they regularly share it on social media or respond positively to reviews?
3. **What format should your content be in?** For example, should it be an audio-only podcast, a video-only channel, or a mixture of both? And what style should it be in – formal or informal?
4. **You'll need to ensure that your content is creative and innovative.** Is something unique about your topic that will make it stand out from the crowd? Or do you have new ideas that could be valuable for others to learn about?
5. **Pick the right niche.** For example, a cooking show may not work well as a podcast, but it could be great as a YouTube series.
6. **You'll want to promote your content in the appropriate channels.** If you're creating a YouTube series based on your podcast, promote it on your podcast platform and your YouTube channel.
7. **Focus on building skills.** If your current skill level is at a beginner level, you may do well making less complex videos and podcasts. Using tools such as Filmora may help you create and edit videos.
8. **How you create and promote content may also depend on your budget.** So be mindful of your budget and expand when you receive the proper engagement.

## Final Words

So, which is excellent in the battle of podcast vs. YouTube video? That depends on your personal preferences. If you'd like to create in-depth, topic-focused content, podcasts are probably a better choice.

If you prefer to create playful and exciting content, then vlogs might be more your thing. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide which format you prefer. You may start with the easier one and learn how to create both podcasts and YouTube videos simultaneously.
