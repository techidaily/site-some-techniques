## Part 6\. The best KineMaster App Alternative on Desktop

Although you can also use the KineMaster app on a desktop by following the instructions above, it can still not compete with any desktop video editor as they have much more powerful and advanced editing tools. So, it's better to use any of its alternatives on the desktop instead of using it.

So, the question now is: Which of its desktop alternatives is the best? It's called [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Considering that it offers a number of cutting-edge features that KineMaster is missing as well. Including motion tracking, keyframing, speed ramping, auto beat sync, Boris FX, NewBlue FX, and many more. Also, its export quality is highly better than KineMaster's as well.

## Conclusion

So, in the end, today's article concludes that KineMaster is undoubtedly one of the best video editing apps available for mobile devices. But if we come to the desktop, it does not look good enough to compete with any desktop editing software as it is made especially for mobile devices. So if you are a desktop user, you should use any of its alternative on a desktop like Wondershare Filmora, which have all the advanced and professional features you want to have in your desktop video editor.
