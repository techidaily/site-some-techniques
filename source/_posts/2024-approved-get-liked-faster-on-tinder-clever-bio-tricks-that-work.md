## Part 3\. Make Him or Her Swipe Right: Create Attractive Profiles

Tinder introduced a Tinder loop, a video feature that increases the chances of getting swiped right. With this attribute, you can capture favorite activities like cliff jumping, and shooting hoops, showcase them to your **Tinder profile**.
