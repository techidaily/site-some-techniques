### Memejacking

Memejacking is using these famous memes as a mode of transportation. Many memes last for weeks, months, or even years, but a brand-new meme is always spreading. Jumping on current trends while they're new and, most crucially, relevant is the key to meme success. Memes that are the result of singular incidents are ideal for this. Everyone shares as many of them as they can when they first appear, but once the meme is finished, it is over.

### "No One" Meme

The "no one" meme is certainly one you've seen flying around the internet. Its purpose is to suggest an unusual or bizarre notion that no one requested in the first place or to draw attention to an oddity that everyone shares but that goes unmentioned, such as turning down the radio in the vehicle while checking up directions.
