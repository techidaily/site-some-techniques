Users that want to access these premium/bonus episodes, ad-free listening, get faster access to their archives and get a first look at new shows can opt for the subscription. The costs can vary as per the channels, with some offering a 7-day trial and USD 3.99 per month or other offers.

### Issue 3: Not connecting to or unavailable Wi-Fi

It is better to choose other networks for users who are not using an active Wi-Fi connection, or the connection is not stable. Allow permissions for accessing the cellular data in your device to the Podcast app instead.

**Fix: Choose cellular data instead**

The steps for activating Cellular data access permission are as follows:

Step1 On your device, click on Settings. Then, choose the Podcasts option.

Step2 Check if the Cellular Data access is active on the app. If not, enable it.

Step3 Disable the "Block Downloads Over Cellular" option if already enabled.

### Issue 4: Bad network connection error

Sometimes, the main cause of the failure to download Apple podcast episodes occurs due to connection issues directly. In this case, users continuously notice problems while trying to download their Podcasts app.

**Fix: Reset the network settings**

You should change your network settings completely to resolve this issue. You will not lose any available data. However, the process involves setting up the Wi-Fi connections fully from the ground-up, so follow the instructions on the screen very carefully.

Go to the Settings menu on your iPhone device and click on the General option. Then, press the Reset option and choose the Reset Network Settings selection.

### Issue 5: App issue

In some cases, the main reason why the podcast downloading process is not working is due to a defect in the app. In this situation, the best solution is to offload the Podcasts app and reinstall it properly.

**Fix: Offloading and Re-downloading Apple Podcasts**

The following steps are important to follow here:

Step1 Go to the Settings menu from your device.

Step2 Click on the General option and choose iPhone Storage. Then, go to Podcasts.

Step3 Under this section, click on the Offload App button.

## Final Words

It is possible to download the Apple Podcasts easily and then download the episodes you subscribe to for offline listening. However, if you cannot download the app or episodes due to a network or software issue, use the right steps to fix them. Understand both sides of the downloading process and experience to make your choice in using it.
