### 02**Choose Like-Minded Photographs**

If you don’t want to make your **Mac photos collage** look like a hot mess, then you’ll want to choose like-minded items. Look at the image below as an example. Each of them has the ‘faded’ pink-filtered kind of look. It makes these photographs great to put together on a collage But, of course, this is quite an extreme example of it.
