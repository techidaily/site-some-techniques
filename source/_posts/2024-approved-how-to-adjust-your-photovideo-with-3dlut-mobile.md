Unedited videos and photos usually have some minor flaws. Usually, it is vital to correct the defects before indulging in applying LUTs. By correcting imperfections such as tone, brightness, shadows, or texture in your photo, you will be giving it that sparkling look before proceeding with the edits.

The adjustments can be made by:

1. Use the ‚ÄúRotate‚Äù Functionality to make your image upright if it is slanted.
2. Alter the lighting levels of your image using the ‚ÄúBrightness‚Äù functionality.
3. Use the ‚ÄúContrast‚Äù option to alter the tones of your image.

Hover through the folders, and once you find one that seems to suit your needs, open it. From the folder, there are various LUts. Navigate through the folder you have selected and match the LUTs with your project image.

Once you find a suitable LUT, use the cursor on the right hand of your image to adjust the levels of LUT in your photo. You can shift to the ‚Äúbasic‚Äù section if you find some required corrections and amend them. Once you make a certain adjustment, your changes are automatically updated.
