In this post, I’m going to discuss some smart ways to **digitize photos** without any hassle.

## 4 Smart Ways to Digitize Your Memorable Old Photos

With time, the way we capture moments has also been changed. These days, Polaroid cameras have been replaced by various smartphones and [4K DSLR cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Nevertheless, you can digitize your photos in either of the following ways so that you can convert them into softcopy and easily move them around.

#### 1\. Use your Smartphones or Digital Cameras

This is something that you might have thought of doing before as well. We all use smartphones to take pictures, but have you ever thought of using the device’s camera to scan your old photographs. The same can be done by using any digital camera too.

Just make sure that you have proper lighting and all the pictures are organized. Now, just use your smartphone camera to take their pictures. Later, you can connect your phone (or its SD card) to your computer and transfer these scanned copies to any secure location. If you want, you can also upload your photos to the cloud to keep them safe.

#### 2\. Use a Scanner

If you have access to a scanner, then it would make it pretty easy for you to digitize photos. Most of the digital scanners won’t even cost that much. Therefore, if you have a lot of pictures to scan, then you can just buy a scanner. You can also find a scanner available at a nearby digital store that you can use on a per-copy basis.

Once you have scanned your photos, you can transfer them to a pen drive or move them to any other device of your choice.

#### 3\. Use a Photo Scanner App

There are also tons of readily available apps that you can use on your Android or iOS devices to digitize photos. You can just go to the App Store or Play Store on your device to browse the available scanner apps (most of them are free).

Some popular photo scanners that you can consider using are Scanner Pro, PhotoScan, ShoeBox, or PicScanner. Out of them, PhotoScan by Google is one of the most reliable options that I would recommend. It will help you easily scan your photos, edit them accordingly, and minimize their glare. You can also directly load your scanned pictures to your Google Photos account from here.

## More Editing Tips for Creating Memorable Videos

To get better results while making your video collage, you can consider following these suggestions.

#### 1\. Get high-quality pictures

When you digitize photos, keep their overall quality in mind. That’s why it is recommended to use a digital camera or a dedicated photo scanner app. In this way, you can maintain the high quality of your photos even when they are inserted into a video.

#### 2\. Maintain a timeline

When you add photos, try to come up with a feasible timeline instead of inserting them randomly. It is recommended to have a chronological timeline so that you can create a story for your audience.

#### 3\. Don’t apply too many effects and transitions

While it is good to have some transitions and effects in your video collage, try not to overdo it. If you have too many animations, then they might take away the essence of the video.

#### 4\. Insert suitable music

The background music in your video is as important as your photos, but a lot of people overlook it. You can easily find royalty-free music from several sources or can even insert any other file that you own. Some applications would also let you insert voiceovers to have that personal effect in your video.

## 4 Smart Ways to Digitize Your Memorable Old Photos

With time, the way we capture moments has also been changed. These days, Polaroid cameras have been replaced by various smartphones and [4K DSLR cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Nevertheless, you can digitize your photos in either of the following ways so that you can convert them into softcopy and easily move them around.

#### 1\. Use your Smartphones or Digital Cameras

This is something that you might have thought of doing before as well. We all use smartphones to take pictures, but have you ever thought of using the device’s camera to scan your old photographs. The same can be done by using any digital camera too.

Just make sure that you have proper lighting and all the pictures are organized. Now, just use your smartphone camera to take their pictures. Later, you can connect your phone (or its SD card) to your computer and transfer these scanned copies to any secure location. If you want, you can also upload your photos to the cloud to keep them safe.

#### 2\. Use a Scanner

If you have access to a scanner, then it would make it pretty easy for you to digitize photos. Most of the digital scanners won’t even cost that much. Therefore, if you have a lot of pictures to scan, then you can just buy a scanner. You can also find a scanner available at a nearby digital store that you can use on a per-copy basis.

Once you have scanned your photos, you can transfer them to a pen drive or move them to any other device of your choice.

#### 3\. Use a Photo Scanner App

There are also tons of readily available apps that you can use on your Android or iOS devices to digitize photos. You can just go to the App Store or Play Store on your device to browse the available scanner apps (most of them are free).

Some popular photo scanners that you can consider using are Scanner Pro, PhotoScan, ShoeBox, or PicScanner. Out of them, PhotoScan by Google is one of the most reliable options that I would recommend. It will help you easily scan your photos, edit them accordingly, and minimize their glare. You can also directly load your scanned pictures to your Google Photos account from here.
