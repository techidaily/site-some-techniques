Users that want to access these premium/bonus episodes, ad-free listening, get faster access to their archives and get a first look at new shows can opt for the subscription. The costs can vary as per the channels, with some offering a 7-day trial and USD 3.99 per month or other offers.

## Part 4\. Where Do Apple Podcast Downloads Go?

Now that you know the right steps to download Apple Podcasts on different devices, the question comes- where to access them? The downloaded episodes of the podcast show you save will go into the Downloaded tab of the app. This happens for both PC and mobile users.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

### Issue 3: Not connecting to or unavailable Wi-Fi

**Fix: Choose cellular data instead**

The steps for activating Cellular data access permission are as follows:

Step1 On your device, click on Settings. Then, choose the Podcasts option.

Step2 Check if the Cellular Data access is active on the app. If not, enable it.
