Before we go to the solution, let's list the devices that are compatible with Airdrop.

## Airdrop not working? Is your device compatible with Airdrop?

Airdrop is one of the latest features of Apple that is not compatible with some of the old devices. Before getting towards the solution, make sure your device comes under these compatible devices.

**To use Airdrop between Mac and iPhone/iPad**

* Mac 2012 or later
* iPhone, iPod, and iPad with iOS 7 or later

**To use Airdrop between two Macs**

* MacBook Pro 2008 and later
* MacBook Air 2010 and later
* MacBook 2008 and later
* iMac 2009 and later

## Airdrop Setting on iOS

Airdrop contains three options to choose from, Off, Contacts Only, and Everyone. The users can select any of these options depending upon their needs and requirements. But the Contacts Only is the most complex option of all. It requires you to verify the person with whom you want to be connected. To avoid this complexity, we recommend you choose "Everyone".

**Step 01:** Open Settings of your iPhone or iPad device.

**Step 02:** From all these options, Tap on General

Sharing something from one device to another device is very common nowadays and Airdrop is one of the best functions in Apple devices that lets you send and receive images, videos, links, and other files through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. But one of the biggest problems that each user of Apple devices faces is the problem of Airdrop not working. It is a common problem that is faced by all users of iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Sending and receiving files through Airdrop is one of the secure and smooth ways. If you are the one facing the problem of Airdrop not working on any of your devices such as iPhone, iPad, or Mac then this article is going to help you fix that problem and enjoy this amazing feature without any hindrance. Before we go to the solution, let's list the devices that are compatible with Airdrop.

## Airdrop not working? Is your device compatible with Airdrop?

Airdrop is one of the latest features of Apple that is not compatible with some of the old devices. Before getting towards the solution, make sure your device comes under these compatible devices.

**To use Airdrop between Mac and iPhone/iPad**

* Mac 2012 or later
* iPhone, iPod, and iPad with iOS 7 or later

**To use Airdrop between two Macs**

* MacBook Pro 2008 and later
* MacBook Air 2010 and later
* MacBook 2008 and later
* iMac 2009 and later
* Mac Mini mid-2010 and later
* Mac Pro early 2009 and mid-2010
* iMac Pro

Now if your device comes under the above categories but you are still unable to use Airdrop properly then try the following adjustments.

## Airdrop Setting on iOS

Airdrop contains three options to choose from, Off, Contacts Only, and Everyone. The users can select any of these options depending upon their needs and requirements. But the Contacts Only is the most complex option of all. It requires you to verify the person with whom you want to be connected. To avoid this complexity, we recommend you choose "Everyone".

**Step 01:** Open Settings of your iPhone or iPad device.

**Step 02:** From all these options, Tap on General

![airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios.png)

**Step 03:** Now select Airdrop

**Step 04:** From these three options, make sure to choose "Everyone"

![airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios2.jpg)

It will make your device visible to everyone around you whether they are on your contact list or not.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Airdrop Setting on Mac

If you are trying to use Airdrop from iPhone or iPad to Mac but the mac is not being shown in the list, try the following steps.

**Step 01:** Click on the Finder

**Step 02:** It will open a new window. Under this window, select Airdrop from the sidebar

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![airdrop-detail-setting-on-mac-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airdrop-detail-setting-on-mac-step2.jpg)

**Step 03:** At the bottom of the screen, you can an option named "Allow me to be discovered by". Click on it and select Everyone from the drop-down list.

![airdrop-detail-setting-on-mac-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airdrop-detail-setting-on-mac-step3.jpg)

By doing this, you will make your Mac device ready to be paired with other devices around you. After changing these settings, the Airdrop will start to work fine.

Is airdrop not working yet? If you are still facing the same problem try toggling off and on the Wifi and Bluetooth of your iPhone and Mac. By doing so, it will refresh the state of Wifi and Bluetooth of your device and make sure that they are working fine.

You can do that on your iPhone simply by navigating to Settings > Wi-Fi. Now tap the Wi-Fi switch on/off twice.

After completing all the stated methods, the Airdrop will start to work properly. But it is important for your device to be compatible with Airdrop. Check your device in the list of compatible devices before trying these methods. If you are still facing the same problem of Airdrop not working, then the last option is to reset your device. To reset your device, follow the following steps.

**For iPhone 7**

1. Press and Hold On/Off button
2. Press and Hold the volume down button until the screen is off and turns on again and displays the Apple logo.

**For iPad & iPhone 6 and earlier**

1. Press and Hold On/Off button.
2. While holding the On/Off button, press and hold the Home button on the front screen of the phone until the screen is turned off and turns On again and shows the Apple logo.

**For iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPad Pro 2018**

1. Click and Release Volume Up button.
2. Click and Release Volume Down button.
3. Press & Hold Sleep button and keep holding it until the screen is off and it is on again.
