## Part 1: The Overall Best Cloud Storage Service

### No.1 iCloud (iPhone & Mac)

Compared to other **cloud storage services**, Apple's iCloud operates a little differently because of its effective integration into both macOS and iOS. You can access it through Windows PCs, but honestly, the only scenario in which it makes sense to use it is if you typically work with Apple gear. In addition to the files, images, and videos kept on your iPhone or iPad, iCloud also stores your messages, calendars, contacts, and a variety of other data.

Once the service is active, you won't need to make any adjustments since most of what is occurring are behind the scenes, which is one of the benefits of this. In addition, when the time comes for you to upgrade to a new Apple device, you will be able to instantly sync all of the information from your previous device within a few minutes.

![icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-2.jpg)

**Reason1: Reasonable price**

Even if the 5 GB of free storage space that comes with iCloud won't meet your needs, particularly if you want to capture photographs and movies, you can purchase more storage space at more affordable costs. These are as follows: 50 GB for $0.99 (or £0.79 per month), 200 GB for $2.99 (or £2.49 per month), and 2 TB for $9.99 (or $6.99 per month), with the latter two choices, also being eligible for inclusion in Apple's Family Sharing feature.

**Reason2: Great data security**

You may even collaborate on papers while protecting them with a password. Two-factor authentication is supported. If you sign up for an iCloud+ subscription, Apple will provide you with iCloud Private Relay so that you may browse the internet without worrying about your privacy. Hide My Email; allows you to generate temporary email addresses rather than reveal your own. And HomeKit Secure Video; if you have a HomeKit security camera or video doorbell, these two apps may help you keep your personal information private.

**Reason3: Great connectivity for apple family users.**

It allows for excellent communication with both close friends and relatives. With iOS 16, the iCloud Shared Photo Library is now accessible on iPhones and other Apple products. This function, which allows family members in the library to share images on iCloud as they are taken, may be switched on or off with a flip of the switch inside the camera app.

### No.2 Google Drive

If you already have a Google account, you are automatically entitled to 15 GB of free storage space in Google Drive. You may use this to create backups of important files, such as documents, images, movies, and anything else you want to keep secure.

The user interface of Drive is uncluttered, straightforward, and only takes about a minute to get used to. It offers helpful capabilities such as sharing URLs to folders (while selecting the amount of control the receiver has), viewing a file even if opened on another device, plus applications for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. However, this does not mean that Drive **cloud storage** is simple.

![google drive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-cloud-storage-3.jpg)

**Reason1: easy to get**

The cloud storage service provided by Google, known as Google Drive, is straightforward to use. Do you own an Android-based device? It is a standard feature. Have you got a Google account? You can get to it using your browser. There are official programs available for both the Mac and iOS platforms, as well as a large number of third-party apps that support Drive. The seamless integration of Drive with the rest of Google's products is a standout feature. It is possible to create, edit, and share cloud files with others using Google Sheets, Docs, and Slides without ever having to download anything. This feature is limited to previewing Office documents.

**Reason2: free 15GB space**

The free plan offers an industry-leading 15 GB of **cloud storage service**. Users can access even more space via third-party applications (Google Photos specifically stores HD photos, for example). Subscribe to the paid Google One service if you find that 15 GB of storage is insufficient. You can select 100 GB for $1.99 or £1.59/month, 200 GB for $2.99 or £2.49 per month, 2 TB for $9.99 or £7.99/month, all the way up to 30 TB for a magnificent price of $299.99 or £239.99/month (a fraction of what Amazon charges for 30 TB!).

**Reason3: Great Connectivity**

Regarding the fundamentals of **personal cloud storage**, Google Drive delivers features such as simple access to data from applications and your browser, the option to recover older versions of files, and offline access when not connected to the Internet. But there is some bad news as well. The syncing process is not as straightforward as it is with some of the company's rivals, and there is no end-to-end encryption. This means that Google could, in principle, see your data.

Several companies have owned it, and SmugMug has been the current owner s ince April 20, 2018\.

**Free 1000-picture storage**

If you think that 1,000 images won't be enough, you have the option to subscribe for simply $7.99 more each month.

You will not need to update your system a second time to get an additional terabyte of storage space.

**Other features.**

Flickr provides a sharing link for images and albums and the ability to manage the groups of people who may see your photos. Additionally, Flickr allows other users who have access to your photos to comment on them, "star" them and follow you to get updates on your photo uploads.

## Part 4: The Cloud Storage Service with Best Price

### IDRIVE

Have a lot of expensive documents to safeguard?

IDrive comes out on top as the most acceptable **cloud storage** option because of its superb backup features, user-friendly applications, high level of data protection, and competitive pricing. There are notable characteristics for every user, like:

You are free to install IDrive on as many different devices as you choose. Plus, if you make changes to a file on one of your devices and then sync it to the others, the changes will take effect immediately.

In addition, extensive backup options make it possible to save anything from individual files and folders to create a whole image of your device, facilitating straightforward recovery in the event of a catastrophe. (If you have a terrible internet connection and the file will take a long time to download, IDrive can even give you a physical drive with all your data, which is a huge advantage.)

Two-factor authentication safeguards your account no matter what you're up to, and end-to-end encryption makes it impossible for anybody to acquire even a whiff of the information you've stored there.

However, if you are not the technical type, don't worry. You can set up IDrive in a matter of moments and forget it's there, allowing the service to do its job. Highly configurable apps enable tweaking all low-level settings (bandwidth throttling, data verification), but if you aren't the technical type, that's okay too.

What's more? Well, check out the fantastic new offer.

Get up to 90% off on 10 terabytes of storage space based on your region. You can also use the company's free lifetime plan with 10 GB of storage space. This plan is ideal for testing the service and determining whether or not it will meet your needs.
