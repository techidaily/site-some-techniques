Vimeo is a popular video streaming platform where you can watch videos all day. Vimeo is a close competitor of YouTube. If you are a regular viewer on Vimeo, you may want to watch a video in a loop. Instead of manually playing the video again and again, you can automatically loop the video on Vimeo.

Besides, if you are a video creator, you may want to loop Vimeo videos for your video project. We will illustrate how to loop video on Vimeo for all scenarios.
