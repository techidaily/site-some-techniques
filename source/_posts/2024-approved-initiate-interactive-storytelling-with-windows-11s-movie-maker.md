## Initiate Interactive Storytelling with Windows 11'S Movie Maker

Microsoft's video editing tool, movie maker, which debuted 19 years ago, did not find the kind of success Microsoft had hoped for, and as a result, the firm was forced to stop supporting it. In a new video, Microsoft wishes to remind users that a superior alternative to Windows Movie Maker is called Clipchamp. However, the demise of the 19-year-old program opened the door for alternative **movie maker windows 11**, which is included with Windows 11.

The corporation reportedly acquired the editing suite Clipchamp last year, and it is reportedly accessible as an "inbox" app for Windows 11\. It will therefore be pre-installed alongside other applications like Microsoft Family. In Windows 11, Clipchamp is intended to take the place of Windows Movie Maker as a video editing program. A recognizable user interface, including templates, project bins, timeline, and more, is provided by Clipchamp for **Windows movie maker 11**. Styles, stock media, transitions and. Filters are all included in the asset libraries that are supplied.
