## Expert-Recommended 6 Online Apps to Delete Background Perfectly

Working remotely has had its advantages. However, one crucial problem is signatures. We work with them a lot, but most of us don't know how to remove a signature's background when it's really urgent.

That's not going to be a problem for you any longer. This guide will show you how to use Microsoft Word, **as well as 5 other online tools**, to easily remove the background of any signature.

## Using Microsoft Word as a Fast Signature Background Remover

Microsoft Word is one of the best options. Most of us already have it installed on our computers anyway.

Just follow these three simple steps and you'll be done in no time.

##### Step1Insert the Image Into Word

The first step is simple. Open up Microsoft Word, click on **Insert** from the upper-left panel, and select the image from your computer.

##### Step1Remove the Background

This step is where most of the work is done.

First, click on the image so it's highlighted. Then, go to the menu at the top and hit **Format.** Look to the upper-left corner and click on **Corrections.** Then, set the parameters exactly as in this image. 馃憞

##### Step3Crop the Image and Save It

Lastly, you should crop out the white spaces near the corners of the signature image. Just select the image and click on **Crop** from the upper-right corner of the screen. Use the black lines around it to crop it.

Then, from the Format menu at the top, click on **Compress Pictures.**

After this, make sure to select the settings as follows:

![word compress pictures settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/compress-picture-settings.png)

The only thing that's left to do now is to save the image. Right-click on the signature and select **Save as Picture.** Then, save it on your computer as a PNG, and you're finally done.
