### Frequently Asked Questions About GIF Apps for iPhone

#### 1\. Can I Make Animated GIFs With iPhone’s Photos App?

Even though the Live Photos feature that is available in the iPhone’s native Photos app enables you to create image loops, you won’t be able to create a real GIF on iPhone without a GIF creator.

Luckily there are a lot of apps in the App Store you can use for free that allows you to create animated GIFs. What’s more, you can use these apps to convert live photos you’ve taken with your iPhone into GIFs and share them on non-Apple devices.

#### 2\. How to Turn Photos Into Animated Gifs on iPhone?

The only way to turn a series of photos into an animated GIF on the iPhone is to install a GIF creator app. Once you’ve gone through the installation process, you just have to upload the photos you want to include in the GIF, add text or apply visual effects and set the loop count value.

The export options vary from one GIF app to the other, but most GIF creators that are compatible with iOS devices allow you to choose the quality of the GIF you’re exporting or allow you to save your GIFs as videos.
