First up is our tutorial on how to **make a collage in Google Photos** (web version) Technically, this can be done on just about any device (your computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.) It can also be done on most OS Systems (Windows and Mac included.) However, our demonstration will be focused on examples that show using it on your desktop.

### 01**Step 1\. Go to Google Photos & Log-In**

To start, open up your desktop browser and go to the Google Photos website. You can also just open it up after logging in to your Google Account and opening the ‘Photos’ app.

### 02**Step 2\. Open 'Utilities’**

Next up, in order to be able to make a **Google collage photo**, you need to head to the ‘Utilities’ page (which you can access through the side menu under ‘LIBRARY’ — as is shown in the image provided.)

![Open Utilities Page Under ‘LIBRARY’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-tip-how-to-create-a-quick-and-easy-google-collage-photo2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Create New ‘Collage’**

Up next, once you’re on the ‘Utilities’ page, locate the ‘Collage’ option under the ‘Create New’ section.

![Choose to Create New ‘Collage’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-tip-how-to-create-a-quick-and-easy-google-collage-photo3.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Select 2-9 Items for Collage**

For the next part, you’ll be prompted to choose the photos you want to make a **Google Photos collage** out of. This is relatively easy. You can scroll through your gallery (starting from the most recent), or you can search your photos for specific images that you want using the toolbar provided.

![Select Photos for Google Photos Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-tip-how-to-create-a-quick-and-easy-google-collage-photo4.png)

### 06**Step 6\. Open Settings Menu for Options**

Your **Google Photos collage** should now be complete To see available share options, open the ‘Settings’ menu on the upper-right hand corner (it’s the three-descending dots the furthest to the right.)

### 08**Step 8\. (Optional) Edit**

If there are any changes that you want to make before downloading it or sending it over to friends and family, Google Photos, thankfully, offers an ‘Edit’ Function that has basic photo editing features that you can use to make some minor changes to the collage.

## Part 2 **How to Make a Photo Collage with Google Photos on Google Photos Application**

Up, next we’ll be teaching you **how to make a collage in Google Photos** (app version) Specifically, we’ll be demonstrating with an iPhone — but you can do this with just about any smartphone or tablet. All you need is a log-in for Google.

### 01**Step 1\. Download Google Photos App**

First of all, in order to have **Google Photos make collage**s for you, you need the app. You can download this on the App-Store. It’s FREE-to-use.

### 02**Step 2\. Allow Google Access to ‘All Photos’**

In order to proceed, you’ll need to give Google Photos permission to access all the photos on your device.

![Allow Google Photos Access to ‘All Photos’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-tip-how-to-create-a-quick-and-easy-google-collage-photo10.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Go to the Library Page**

Unlike the web version of Google Photos, the app version has the **make collage in Google photos** feature under the ‘Library’ page (which you can find on the bottom-right corner of the interface.
