## From Laggard to Lightning: Pick 8 Apps Now

In video playback, how the content plays out and the playback's speed determines content quality. Many editors add slow-motion effects to videos or parts to create a stylish and top-notch look.

However, this effect becomes a default in the videos after adding it, and users cannot easily deactivate the setting. It can get annoying to deal with when you are trying to play a video, but it starts automatically playing in slow-motion on your video player. Thus, for most users, learning **how to change slow-motion video to normal-speed Android** is important.

In general, there is no built-in feature that allows Android users to change recorded video speed, like reversing slow motion. So, it would be best if you considered third-party tools in this case. Multiple options are usable in this context, and we explain some of the best ones here. Interested? Give this a read.

## FAQs

1. **Why do my videos play automatically in slow motion?**

If a video was created with a slow-motion effect, the recorded video would automatically play in slow motion when you play it in another video player. It is important to manually change the settings or adjust the video speed directly.

1. **How do I record a slow-motion video on my Android phone?**

It is possible to record videos in slow-motion on Android phones using the editor app you are using. There are no preset speed customization settings in Android smartphones for video speed. So, you have to download and use a compatible video editing app for the function.

1. **How can I convert my slow-motion video to better quality?**

You can use different tools to convert a slow-motion video to a higher speed. The best software for that is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), with strong and multi-level video editing functions.
