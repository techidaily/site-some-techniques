## How To Use Green Screen In KineMaster

**Green screen, or chroma key in KineMaster, is a special effects technique. With it, you can replace the background of a video with a different image or video.**

Follow these steps to use the **green screen in KineMaster** to take your video editing to the next level:

Step1 Head to [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexstreaming.app.kinemasterfree&hl=en&gl=US) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kinemaster-video-editor/id1609369954)and install **KineMaster** on your device. Launch the app and choose the **aspect ratio**. Tap the **"Media"** option from the right side of the screen. Select the video clips with **chroma-key** and import them to the **timeline.**

Step2 Next, select all the video clips with the **green screen** and open the right-hand side **menu.** Scroll down and tap **"Chroma Key"** to remove the color from the videos.
