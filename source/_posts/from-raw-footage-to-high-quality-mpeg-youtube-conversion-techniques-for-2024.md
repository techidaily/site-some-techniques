## Hot FAQs on YouTube to MPEG Converting

### 1\. Is MPEG 4 the same as MP4? Which is better?

MPEG 4 is a type of overall term developed under the Moving Pictures Experts Group that includes multiple media containers. Therefore, it is suitable for sharing multiple video-based contents across the internet. In comparison, MP4 is one of the media containers under this broad umbrella, which focuses on file compression, e.g., videos/images.
