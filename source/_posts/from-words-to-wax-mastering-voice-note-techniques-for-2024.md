Do you still type to organize meeting minutes or song lyrics after you have recorded them using Voice Memos? This requires a lot of effort and takes a lot of time. Being able to directly convert voice to text will significantly increase your productivity. Here we have introduced useful methods on 3 platforms to transcribe voice to text.

### On iPhone

**[Transcribe - Speech to Text](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transcribe-speech-to-text/id1241342461?platform=iphone)**

Transcribe – Speech to text is one of the best apps to convert your voice into text using an iPhone. It offers excellent AI conversion with easy-to-use interface.

**[Rev Voice Recorder & Memos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/revvoicerecorder/id598332111?referrer=click%3Dde4d5f16-b9cd-44de-a19a-e2bb29ee0aae?platform=iphone)**

Rev Voice Recorder & Memos is another app that iPhone users can use to transcribe their memos into text. Unlike Transcribe – Speech to Text, the Rev is not only an excellent transcribing tool but also a great tool for recording audio with good features.

**[Just Press Record](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/just-press-record/id1033342465?platform=iphone)**

Although being a paid program, it operates easily and has a simpler user interface. In addition to the accurate conversion feature, the program also allows for immediate recording and iCloud syncing.

**[Dictation - Speech to text](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dictation-speech-to-text/id1124772331)**

Instead of typing, you can speak your content directly. There is no time limit for dictation. Voice Memos can be translated into any language and converted to text by Dictation – Speech to text.

### On Mac

These are the most effective ways to transcribe your voice recordings into text on Mac:

**[Dictation](https://support.apple.com/en-hk/guide/mac-help/mh40584/mac)**
