The podcasts available in the app were originally in Google Play Music. But after its discontinuation in 2020, the podcasts have moved to this separate platform. However, the links of the available shows and branding have become new, so it is important to update that information on your channel and transfer the audience there. As for this app itself, it is still ongoing.
