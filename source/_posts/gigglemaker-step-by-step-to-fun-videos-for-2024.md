## Part 4: How to Edit Your Funimate Account

Funimate may be used to create a slideshow of photographs with text art and dynamic text. Users may use this application to edit their movies by trimming, cutting, cropping, merging, duplicating, collaging, and looping clips. Users may also use features to blur, vary the pace, fade in and out, animate text, add GIFs, and include music to their films. However, if you've been using Funimate for a time, it's not uncommon to decide to modify one or both. Perhaps you used your actual name and were unaware that it would be made public. Perhaps the name you initially picked is no longer appropriate for the sort of material you want to publish. Or maybe you've just decided that you'd rather be known by something more intriguing.

**Step to Edit Free Funimate Pro Account**

Step 1: Launch the Funimate app and choose the Profile option in the lower right corner of the screen.

![launch funimate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-funimate-app.jpg)

## Conclusion

With the proper privacy settings, Funimate is suitable for adult adolescent users. By default, Funimate profiles are set to public, however, they may be changed to private. Having a private account is significantly safer for children, particularly if they wish to make videos of themselves. Users may opt to make individual videos private if they wish to have a public profile. A full profile page is an excellent method to persuade people to follow you on Funimate. However, to remain current, you need to update it regularly. Just be cautious not to make too many changes, since this may make it difficult for your followers to keep up.

Users may also use features to blur, vary the pace, fade in and out, animate text, add GIFs, and include music to their films. However, if you've been using Funimate for a time, it's not uncommon to decide to modify one or both. Perhaps you used your actual name and were unaware that it would be made public. Perhaps the name you initially picked is no longer appropriate for the sort of material you want to publish. Or maybe you've just decided that you'd rather be known by something more intriguing.

**Step to Edit Free Funimate Pro Account**

Step 1: Launch the Funimate app and choose the Profile option in the lower right corner of the screen.

Step 2: Choose Shoot a Video or Edit to update your feed and for the profile name, go to the sign up step to enter your new name here. In the case of your username, keep in mind that it must be unique.

Step 3: Navigate to your profile page on the Funimate app. Tap on the 'Profile' icon in the bottom right-hand corner to view your profile. After all, your social media profile photo is part of how you promote yourself to the world.

Step 4: Choose one of the choices shown in the popup window. You may upload a picture, snap a new one, or just examine your existing photo and crop it again to improve it.

Step 5: Whether you want more followers or want people to understand your content area better, you should describe it in your bio. This is a short tagline that informs other users about what they can anticipate from your Funimate account.

## Conclusion

With the proper privacy settings, Funimate is suitable for adult adolescent users. By default, Funimate profiles are set to public, however, they may be changed to private. Having a private account is significantly safer for children, particularly if they wish to make videos of themselves. Users may opt to make individual videos private if they wish to have a public profile. A full profile page is an excellent method to persuade people to follow you on Funimate. However, to remain current, you need to update it regularly. Just be cautious not to make too many changes, since this may make it difficult for your followers to keep up.
