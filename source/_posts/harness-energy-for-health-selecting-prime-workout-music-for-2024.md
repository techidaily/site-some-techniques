In Tantric and Vedic traditions, a mantra is repeated 108 times. It's a lot more powerful than 107 or 109 repetitions. That's why 108 prayer beads are used in the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Islamic, and Taoist religions to help maintain a sense of spiritual well-being.

It's the Gayatri mantra, one of the oldest and most powerful mantras in Sanskrit. Gayatri means life force, life essence, and power of the breath. If you chant the Gayatri mantra and strongly establish it in your mind, living according to the duty you are born for and the work ordained for you, you will lead an entire and happy life.

## Final Words

In conclusion, the music you listen to is vital. It's a great way to get motivated and focused. Many people use background music to get themselves going in the morning. This can also be helpful when trying to focus and block out distracting sounds during a stressful situation.

We've compiled the best background music above for working out and yoga for you. They are a perfect mix of beats and bpm for keeping you in the zone and motivated. So download, listen, and choose which one works best for you.

In addition, I'd recommend that you try to keep your background music to an even volume throughout the class. The last thing you want is for you to get distracted or feel annoyed. And if you're looking for more motivation, try listening to motivational quotes or inspirational speeches before and after your workout.
