The output values are not from each respective combination in a color space.

It is a bit complex when customizing the basic settings such as contrast and white balance. Usually, the final result becomes remarkable.

##### 1D LUT

The color and luma are placed in a 1D; hence quite not easy to work on.

## How to Import 3D LUT to Photoshop

There are some 3D LUTs that Adobe Photoshop provides. Usually, these LUTs are limited and are not very effective when working on major projects. Most people, therefore, prefer to add their own 3D LUTs to Photoshop.

There are two ways to import 3D LUT to Photoshop; Adding LUTs to a specific project and Installing LUTs.

Before applying any of the two methods, you need to ensure you have your LUTs right there. You can purchase them or get them for free. Download them to your computer device.

#### Method 1\. Adding LUTs to a Particular Project

This first step is undemanding since you only have to locate a given LUT and then directly incorporate it into your project.

### Step 1\. Unzip your LUTs

First, you ought to unzip your files. In Mac devices, you double-click on the file to unzip it, whereas, in Windows, you right-click then select “Extract all” from the drop-down list.

#### Method 2\. Installing LUTs

### Step 2\. Create a new Folder

### Step 3\. Copy and Paste your LUTs

Copy your LUTs and paste them to the folder you have just created.

### Step 4\. Restart Photoshop

Lastly, restart your Photoshop app. You can access your new files by clicking “Color Lookup” > “Adjustment layer.” Usually, the files are saved as .cube files.

● When using LUTs, there are a couple of things that you need to have right under your nose:
