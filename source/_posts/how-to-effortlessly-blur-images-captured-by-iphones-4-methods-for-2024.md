## How to Effortlessly Blur Images Captured by iPhones (4 Methods)

While taking the images is merely the process of tapping the ‘Capture’ button, getting them from the correct angle and with proper lighting is an art. Because many smartphones nowadays offer the best picture quality when it comes to snapping photos using their camera, it is imperative to learn **how to blur a picture on iPhone** so the main subject grabs the limelight, hence making the other objects in the background get the least focus.

That said, when it is said **how to blur photos on iPhone**, it practically means that you are learning the process of blurring the background so the main subject (a person or an object) gets the most attention, and that’s what is explained in the following sections.

There are multiple ways to get this done. For instance, the background of the photos can be blurred while shooting even on the older iPhones. Likewise, if you already have an image, you can use the Photos app’s built-in effects, or download a third-party program to get the job done.

## Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone

You can learn **how to blur an image on iPhone** using Portrait mode by following the instructions given below:

**Step 1: Launch the Camera App**

Grab your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustration), and tab the **Camera** icon from the Home screen to launch the app.

**Step 2: Get to the Portrait Mode and Adjust the Depth**

Swipe-drag the modes present above the **Shutter** button to switch to the **PORTRAIT** option, and tap the main subject on the screen that you want to capture the image of. Next, tap the **f** (**Depth**) icon from the top-right corner, and drag the **Depth** slider to the left to increase the intensity of the blur effect of the background.

## Part 2: Take a Photo with a Blurred Background on Older iPhones by Getting Closer to the Subject

You can learn how to do this by following the steps given below:

**Step 1: Get to the Camera App**

Use the method explained above to launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone. Because it’s an old model that doesn’t have Portrait mode, you can stay in the **PHOTO** mode.

Next, use two fingers to drag inwards or outwards on the screen to decrease or increase the effective area respectively.

**Step 4: Blur the Photo and Export**

From the top, ensure that the **Blur Strength** option is selected, tap anywhere on the screen, and drag to the right to increase the intensity of the blurriness. Optionally, you can tap the Effect Types icon from the bottom, and tap to choose **Vignette Strength** from the box that comes up.

Then, as earlier, drag your finger to the right or left anywhere on the screen to increase or decrease the intensity of the effect respectively. Once done, tap the **OK** button (with the tick mark) from the bottom-right corner. Back on the main screen, tap **EXPORT** from the bottom-right, you tap your preferred option for exporting.

**Conclusion**

Blurring the background in a photo ensures that the main subject remains in the focus, and all the other unimportant objects don’t steal the limelight. If you are using iPhone 7 Plus or above models, the background of the photos can be blurred at the time of capturing. Furthermore, the built-in Photos app in iPhones also come with the Vignette effect that enables you to do the job with ease. However, if you want precision and more control over the images while blurring, you can use an efficient third-party tool like Snapseed that also has its own set of tutorials to teach **how to blur a picture on iPhone**.
