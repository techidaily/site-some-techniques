![hdr labs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-6.jpg)

Rating 4.3 / 5

HDR Lab is another website with some fantastic sky HDR images. With multiple locations, different sun angles, clouds, and a wide range of colors, you will surely find what you are looking for here. HDR lab is precisely what the name suggests. It contains all the tools and tutorials needed to start working on HDR images.

The images are not too complex, making them perfect for beginners. HDR lab will introduce you to the future of imaging, taking you step by step, especially for young digital artists.

**Our Verdict**

However, the website does not have a very intuitive interface, even though it is easy to navigate. The ads that pop up might get frustrating and distracting after a while. Apart from that, the images are directly downloaded into your computer without you first having a look at them, making it difficult to choose if you want to look at multiple pictures before deciding on one.
