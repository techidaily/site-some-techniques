Have you ever watched a video on your iPhone and thought it didn't look so great? The colors were off, the blurry image and the white balance were blown out. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you know what I'm talking about. You've got a video that you shot on your iPhone. It looks great, but what if you want to make it a little more "professional"? There are times when you have dark lighting, or the sun is in your face, regardless of what's causing the lighting to be dim.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then videos are worth more than spoken language. Today the trend is high-quality videos on social media platforms, and your video should be perfect. But sometimes, we face trouble with our video. Not every video you take has the correct exposure or brightness. The video can have the wrong color balance, but a few tricks enhance iPhone video brightness within a few minutes.

## How will brightness affect your video?

Brightness is one of the most significant factors in determining image quality. Anytime someone talks about color, they mention brightness. A system's brightness can display light and dark details in an image. The ability to display brightness significantly impacts video quality because the video camera captures much brighter or darker images than standard video signals can handle. Brightness may be used as an important controlling factor for video effects (e.g., producing a realistic effect, making a shot more dramatic). However, if brightness is not well controlled, the desired effect of the scene may also change dramatically, and these changes will be visible to viewers.

Brightness, or the lack of it, will significantly impact how your video looks to your viewers. As you know, brightness and contrast affect how much information is revealed in an image. It depends on the brightness level to display the video with precise white balance, thus optimizing the video image quality. The brightness/contrast settings should always be adjusted carefully during editing and mastering your videos to display colors and shades accurately.

## 3 Simple Methods to Brighten a Video on iPhone

In this article, you'll learn three methods to brighten your videos on your iPhone if you're experiencing poor video quality.

### Method1: Brighten a video on iPhone using iMovie

A popular video editing app for iPhones (and iPads, iPod Touches, and Macs) is iMovie, developed by Apple Inc. With iMovie's latest version, not only can you edit videos, but you can also modify and enhance video color settings. For example, you can make automatic color adjustments, match the look of one clip to another, fix a discolored clip, adjust the clip's color by adjusting its skin tone, and make manual color adjustments. The iMovie App on iPhone allows you to quickly change your video's lighting. Just follow the steps mentioned below.

### Step 1

First of all, open the iMovie app on your iPhone. A simple interface will appear on your screen.

Have you ever watched a video on your iPhone and thought it didn't look so great? The colors were off, the blurry image and the white balance were blown out. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you know what I'm talking about. You've got a video that you shot on your iPhone. It looks great, but what if you want to make it a little more "professional"? There are times when you have dark lighting, or the sun is in your face, regardless of what's causing the lighting to be dim.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then videos are worth more than spoken language. Today the trend is high-quality videos on social media platforms, and your video should be perfect. But sometimes, we face trouble with our video. Not every video you take has the correct exposure or brightness. The video can have the wrong color balance, but a few tricks enhance iPhone video brightness within a few minutes.

## How will brightness affect your video?

Brightness is one of the most significant factors in determining image quality. Anytime someone talks about color, they mention brightness. A system's brightness can display light and dark details in an image. The ability to display brightness significantly impacts video quality because the video camera captures much brighter or darker images than standard video signals can handle. Brightness may be used as an important controlling factor for video effects (e.g., producing a realistic effect, making a shot more dramatic). However, if brightness is not well controlled, the desired effect of the scene may also change dramatically, and these changes will be visible to viewers.

Brightness, or the lack of it, will significantly impact how your video looks to your viewers. As you know, brightness and contrast affect how much information is revealed in an image. It depends on the brightness level to display the video with precise white balance, thus optimizing the video image quality. The brightness/contrast settings should always be adjusted carefully during editing and mastering your videos to display colors and shades accurately.

## 3 Simple Methods to Brighten a Video on iPhone

In this article, you'll learn three methods to brighten your videos on your iPhone if you're experiencing poor video quality.

### Method1: Brighten a video on iPhone using iMovie

A popular video editing app for iPhones (and iPads, iPod Touches, and Macs) is iMovie, developed by Apple Inc. With iMovie's latest version, not only can you edit videos, but you can also modify and enhance video color settings. For example, you can make automatic color adjustments, match the look of one clip to another, fix a discolored clip, adjust the clip's color by adjusting its skin tone, and make manual color adjustments. The iMovie App on iPhone allows you to quickly change your video's lighting. Just follow the steps mentioned below.

### Step 1

First of all, open the iMovie app on your iPhone. A simple interface will appear on your screen.

![how to brighten a video on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-brighten-a-video-on-iphone-1.jpg)

### Step 2

Click on the “+” icon to create a new project and select the movie option.

![brighten a video on iphone using imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-brighten-a-video-on-iphone-2.png)

### Step 3

Now, from the media, you can import the desired video from your iPhone, of which you want to improve the brightness. Select a video clip in the timeline to open the inspector when your project has opened.

### Step 4

Tap "Filter" to apply a brightening filter to your iPhone video. A preview will be shown in the viewer as you apply the filter. You can turn off filters by tapping "None." There are plenty of filters, and you can give them a try to see which one enhances your video better.

### Method2: Brighten a video on iPhone using Photo Album editing

If you have an iPhone, then you can easily enhance the brightness of your video using the default photos app. Let's take a look at how to brighten a video you have on your iPhone, using the photos app that comes by default in your apple devices. Just follow the steps given below.

### Step 1

First of all, unlock your iPhone and open the Photos app. Now select the desired video in which you want to increase the brightness from albums by tapping on it.

### Step 2

Once you have selected the video, you will see an edit option on the top right corner of your screen. Tap the Brightness icon in the bottom menu bar. To change the strength of an effect, slide the dial at the bottom left or right.
