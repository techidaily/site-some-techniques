 GpPro has recently developed their personal drone that is compatible with complete GoPro action camera series - [GoPro Karma](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Although this device is not as good as other competing drones available in market but its light weight, compact design and easy assembly make it best choice for learners. Inside the drone case, you will be able to find a hand held type gimbal and it is compatible with remote control unit so you need not to make connections via your phone's cable. Its battery causes some power losses that most of users may find disappointing. Its maximum in air time is 20 minutes and range goes up to 1000 meters.
