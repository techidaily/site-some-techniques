Here’re a few useful tips to make the perfect photo collage:

#### Size

Choosing the size of pictures is one of the most key considerations. When creating a collage, you can work with a mix of sizes. If you wish to highlight any particular photo, use a large size for it. Keep in mind that the layout affects the images you select.

#### Colors

When creating a collage, ensure that the snapshots you choose complement each other. The color scheme must blend in perfectly and should appeal to the eyes. Never put together colors that clash with each other. Pick photos in contrasting colors or you might also arrange the colors in a pattern around the collage.

#### Themes

It is always advisable to create a photo collage based on a theme. Choose photos that best describe your chosen image. For instance; if you are creating a collage for your brother’s birthday, you can choose snapshots highlighting the special events in his life.

#### Borders and Frames

#### Size

Choosing the size of pictures is one of the most key considerations. When creating a collage, you can work with a mix of sizes. If you wish to highlight any particular photo, use a large size for it. Keep in mind that the layout affects the images you select.

#### Colors

When creating a collage, ensure that the snapshots you choose complement each other. The color scheme must blend in perfectly and should appeal to the eyes. Never put together colors that clash with each other. Pick photos in contrasting colors or you might also arrange the colors in a pattern around the collage.
