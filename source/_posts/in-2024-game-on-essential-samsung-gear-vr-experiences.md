Below is a table of overview of the games.

 Below here is a brief of each of the game stated in the table.

## [Sky fighter](https://sky-fighter.com/  )

You have to reach to those lanterns quickly since they will guide you through the drawback of your memories. There are 10 levels in this game and you will have to fight with the gravity as well since this will pull you down the holes. So, be very careful!
