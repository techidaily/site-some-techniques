Now, you can either publish the video to your Instagram profile directly or save it to your phone if you want.

## FAQs About Video Brightness

#### How is video brightness measured?

Video brightness is measured in terms of the maximum brightness. The higher the brightness, the more luminous the picture will be. This means that bright and dark scenes will both be more easily identifiable.

In technical terms, the brightness of a video image is measured in nits. One nit is equal to one candela per square meter. If you have a television or monitor that is rated at 100 nits, it means it has a luminance of 100 Candelas per square meter (cd/m2).

#### What should my video brightness be?

The brightness of your videos should always be medium. Too much or too little brightness can make the video look unnatural, and viewers may be able to see details in the video. Also, too much brightness will cause color saturation problems.

#### Is it easy to brighten a video?

Video Brightener apps like Filmora are mainly designed to do this task. It is pretty easy to use and can be operated by anyone, whether they are an expert or a newbie. All you need to do is download the software and follow some simple steps, and your task will be done within a few minutes.

#### What can I do if my video brightness is low?

The first and easiest way is to change your lighting. For example, if you have a window in your video and it's behind your subject, turn them around, so they're facing the window. If you have already recorded the video and want to increase the brightness of an existing video, you can use different video editing software to increase the brightness.

#### Is it free to brighten a video?

Yes! It is free to brighten a video, and we have shared a method in this article in which you can use Instagram. However, there are some paid apps also like Filmora. Using Filmora is free of cost, but the output will have a watermark on it. If you want to get rid of the watermark, you will need to purchase a subscription.

#### Is it the level of white in the video?

The brightness of a video refers to the level of white in the video. It is different from lightness, which refers to the average level of all colors in a frame. The brightness is measured by calculating the average value of all color channels in the frame. This can be used to adjust the contrast and brightness by increasing or decreasing this value.

#### Will I lose any quality when brightening a video?

There is a relatively simple answer to this question. When you are brightening a video that is too dark, there is no degradation in the quality of the image as long as you aren't drastically changing brightness levels. If you make minimal adjustments, there shouldn't be any noticeable difference in the overall quality of the original image.

#### How do I fix my video brightness on the fly?

If you need to adjust the brightness of your video, a video editing app like Filmora can help. These apps make it easy to edit and enhance your video on the fly.
