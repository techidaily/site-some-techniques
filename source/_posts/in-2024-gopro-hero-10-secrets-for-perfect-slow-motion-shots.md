## Part 1: What is a Slow Motion Shot?

Before we go any further, let's talk about what a slow-motion shot is and what it implies in practice. As the name indicates, a slow-motion shot is a video in which the pace of the video has been slowed down significantly.

Aesthetically, slow-motion views are pretty pleasing to the eye, and they do an excellent job of drawing attention to significant movements and elements in the film.

More specifically, slow-motion is a filmmaking method in which movement inside a frame is made to look slower than the original video.

Although it seems counter-intuitive, all slow-motion is produced via high-speed video footage. When we say "high speed," we are referring to a greater frame rate on the computer.

## Part 2: What Matters For Slow Motion Videos?

So, what really matters while shooting slow mos? The following are some of the key aspects to take into account that will be crucial for your future footage:

**Light of the Shot**

You must keep one point in mind when choosing higher [frame rates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for your photographs â€” more excellent frame rates imply that your camera's shutter would be open for a shorter time. Consequently, less light is allowed to reach the camera's image sensor.

The video becomes darker and more grainy as a result of this. To avoid going overboard with raising frame rates in low-light situations, it is advised that you keep them at a reasonable level. Consider employing a light source if you want to shoot ultra slow-motion film, but the surrounding area is dark.

**2\. Resolution of the Sho**

It's a no-brainer that high-resolution video is required for high-quality photos, so why not use the highest resolution possible? The same may be said about slow-motion images as well.

And the good news is that you can capture slow-motion footage at a quality of up to 5.3K with the GoPro Hero 10 Black! Yes, you can slow down films recorded at 5.3K quality with the GoPro Hero 10 Black by up to two times.

You may also slow it down by as much as four times if the resolution is 4K or 2.7K. Super-slow-motion movies may be captured at 1080p HD quality, with speeds lowered by an incredible 8x.

The following table shows the frame rates supplied by the GoPro Hero 10 Black at various resolutions, which will help you understand how the resolutions and frame rates function.

| Resolution | Frame rate               |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 1080p      | 240, 120, 60, 30, 24 fps |
| 2.7K       | 120, 60, 30, 24 fps      |
| 4K         | 120, 60, 30, 24 fps      |
| 5.3K       | 60, 30, 24 fps           |

**3\. Frame Rate of the Shot**

When shooting slow-motion recordings, the video frame rate is the most critical factor to consider. The higher the video frame rate, the greater the amount of time you may slow down the video without harming its overall quality.

You'll get cinematic scenes at typical rates when you film a video at a high frame rate, such as 24 or 30 frames per second. In contrast, the result will be less than pleasing if you try to slow down the film with such frame rates.

Increase the frame rate to, for example, 60 frames per second, and you will be able to slow the film down by up to 2x (to obtain 30 frames per second) while still getting a professional-looking clip.

Similarly, the film captured at 120 frames per second may be slowed down by up to four times. Two hundred forty frames per second are recommended for people who wish to capture super-slow-motion film. If you shoot at such a high frame rate, you'll be able to slow down the film by an incredible 8x.

## Part 3: Best GoPro Hero 10 Slow Motion Settings For Different Activities

A list of suggested settings for your GoPro Hero 10 Black has been developed to assist you in getting the most out of your camera.

* Is low-light photography something that you're interested in? **3K/60 frames** per second is the optimal frame rate for removing graininess and noise from your videos, according to industry experts.

* Those engaged in high-intensity sports such as cycling, biking, and driving benefit from **4K/120 fps** recording, which is also the most popular option.

* High-resolution super-slow-motion footage of rapid action hobbies such as surfing, rafting, and skiing in broad daylight may be captured in **1080p/240fps** at high frame rates.

## Part 4: How to Record Slow Motion Footage On Gopro Hero 10?

Slow-motion video can be captured with the GoPro Hero 10 in a cinch. The following are the stages that must be completed:

**Step 1**: Before you begin filming, use the **Slo-Mo shortcut** to modify the recording speed of your video before you begin.

**Step2**: Slow motion may be selected at two different speeds using the **Slider**: 2x, 4x, or 8x.

**Step 3:** Finally, press the **Shutter** button to begin recording your session.

Please remember that the possible speeds may vary depending on the resolution and digital lens you choose. For instance, when you're filming in 4K resolution, the possible speeds would be 2x and 4x; meanwhile, when you're filming in 1080p, the available levels would be 8x and 16x.

_Additionally, you may use the GoPro Quik on your phone to edit previously recorded GoPro videos for use in Slow Motion videos. Follow these instructions to get started._

**Step 1:** **Create** a new edit in the GoPro Quik (or open an existing one).

**Step 2:** At the base of the preview screen, click the **clips** button.

**Step 3:** Now, **select the video** **clip** to slow down.

**Step 4:** You'll get a more detailed preview of the video. Now, choose Trim using the **scissor** symbol (at the bottom).

**Step 5**: Change the Slow Motion option to ON on the next screen. You're finished, so press the **OK** button.

**Step 6:** You will now be able to see the slow-motion video.

That's all there is to it! Slow-motion videos may be **_saved_**, **_exported_**, and shared. You can also try some other [slo-mo video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on Windows and Mac to edit a GoPro video.

## Part 5: Tips For Shooting Better Slow Motion Videos With Gopro

Our favorite part of the process is finally here: the actual shooting. Our slow-motion films had improved dramatically when we started following these basic guidelines. Here are a few pointers for you:

**1\. Avoid Taking Slo-Mo Shots in Dim/Dull Light**

In low-light situations, slow-motion videography is likely to result in a noisy video. This is because your camera has a faster shutter speed. Remember that as you raise FPS, your shutter speed will speed up, making your picture seem darker, so keep that in mind.

To compensate for low light, the GoPro would increase your ISO, which would result in video noise, as shown in the above shot.

The shutter speed should be twice as fast as the frame rate. Two hundred forty frames per second mean a shutter speed of 1/480 of a second. You'll get clean, noise-free images using this technique if the lighting is good.

**2\. Get Close to the Subject**

What's the point of recording a slow-motion video if you're 50 feet away from the subject? You get the point, right? It's always best that you stay near the subject, focus well, stabilize the camera, and capture the best-possible angled shot for your fellows to see!

**3\. Hold the Camera in a Stable Position**

A stable film is necessary for smooth slow-mo scenes. As a result, use the digital stabilization into the GoPro camera whenever possible. Use a gimbal or other camera stabilizing assistance in low light instead of digital stabilization (even a simple GoPro stick can do).

Another way to stabilize your video is to move your body naturally while you're filming. Bend your knees and use both hands to hold the camera.

**4\. Take Planned Shots**

Make use of planned shots when you get the opportunity. First, let's set the scene in our minds. Afterward, we'll either write it all down on paper or develop a storyboard, depending on how involved the shot is. You'll save time on filming and editing if you put effort into setting up the scenarioâ€”any time, not only while using slow motion.

**Conclusion**

Well, there you have it â€“ everything you wanted to know about GoPro Slow Motion videos. Most GoPro devices make it simple to capture some incredible Slow Motion footage.

All of the most current GoPro models, which can record super-slow-motion film at speeds lowered by 8x (at 1080p), provide exceptional quality for your slow-motion video clip. Especially version 10 of the game.

In addition, we've included some helpful pointers which will make filming slow-motion footage with your GoPro 10 a lot simpler. We hope you have found this tutorial to be informative and valuable.

## Part 5: Tips For Shooting Better Slow Motion Videos With Gopro

Our favorite part of the process is finally here: the actual shooting. Our slow-motion films had improved dramatically when we started following these basic guidelines. Here are a few pointers for you:

**1\. Avoid Taking Slo-Mo Shots in Dim/Dull Light**

In low-light situations, slow-motion videography is likely to result in a noisy video. This is because your camera has a faster shutter speed. Remember that as you raise FPS, your shutter speed will speed up, making your picture seem darker, so keep that in mind.

To compensate for low light, the GoPro would increase your ISO, which would result in video noise, as shown in the above shot.

The shutter speed should be twice as fast as the frame rate. Two hundred forty frames per second mean a shutter speed of 1/480 of a second. You'll get clean, noise-free images using this technique if the lighting is good.

**2\. Get Close to the Subject**

What's the point of recording a slow-motion video if you're 50 feet away from the subject? You get the point, right? It's always best that you stay near the subject, focus well, stabilize the camera, and capture the best-possible angled shot for your fellows to see!

**3\. Hold the Camera in a Stable Position**

A stable film is necessary for smooth slow-mo scenes. As a result, use the digital stabilization into the GoPro camera whenever possible. Use a gimbal or other camera stabilizing assistance in low light instead of digital stabilization (even a simple GoPro stick can do).

Another way to stabilize your video is to move your body naturally while you're filming. Bend your knees and use both hands to hold the camera.

**4\. Take Planned Shots**

Make use of planned shots when you get the opportunity. First, let's set the scene in our minds. Afterward, we'll either write it all down on paper or develop a storyboard, depending on how involved the shot is. You'll save time on filming and editing if you put effort into setting up the scenarioâ€”any time, not only while using slow motion.

**Conclusion**

Well, there you have it â€“ everything you wanted to know about GoPro Slow Motion videos. Most GoPro devices make it simple to capture some incredible Slow Motion footage.

All of the most current GoPro models, which can record super-slow-motion film at speeds lowered by 8x (at 1080p), provide exceptional quality for your slow-motion video clip. Especially version 10 of the game.

In addition, we've included some helpful pointers which will make filming slow-motion footage with your GoPro 10 a lot simpler. We hope you have found this tutorial to be informative and valuable.

## Part 1: What is a Slow Motion Shot?

Before we go any further, let's talk about what a slow-motion shot is and what it implies in practice. As the name indicates, a slow-motion shot is a video in which the pace of the video has been slowed down significantly.

Aesthetically, slow-motion views are pretty pleasing to the eye, and they do an excellent job of drawing attention to significant movements and elements in the film.

More specifically, slow-motion is a filmmaking method in which movement inside a frame is made to look slower than the original video.

Although it seems counter-intuitive, all slow-motion is produced via high-speed video footage. When we say "high speed," we are referring to a greater frame rate on the computer.

## Part 2: What Matters For Slow Motion Videos?

So, what really matters while shooting slow mos? The following are some of the key aspects to take into account that will be crucial for your future footage:

**Light of the Shot**

You must keep one point in mind when choosing higher [frame rates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for your photographs â€” more excellent frame rates imply that your camera's shutter would be open for a shorter time. Consequently, less light is allowed to reach the camera's image sensor.

The video becomes darker and more grainy as a result of this. To avoid going overboard with raising frame rates in low-light situations, it is advised that you keep them at a reasonable level. Consider employing a light source if you want to shoot ultra slow-motion film, but the surrounding area is dark.

**2\. Resolution of the Sho**

It's a no-brainer that high-resolution video is required for high-quality photos, so why not use the highest resolution possible? The same may be said about slow-motion images as well.

And the good news is that you can capture slow-motion footage at a quality of up to 5.3K with the GoPro Hero 10 Black! Yes, you can slow down films recorded at 5.3K quality with the GoPro Hero 10 Black by up to two times.

You may also slow it down by as much as four times if the resolution is 4K or 2.7K. Super-slow-motion movies may be captured at 1080p HD quality, with speeds lowered by an incredible 8x.

The following table shows the frame rates supplied by the GoPro Hero 10 Black at various resolutions, which will help you understand how the resolutions and frame rates function.

| Resolution | Frame rate               |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 1080p      | 240, 120, 60, 30, 24 fps |
| 2.7K       | 120, 60, 30, 24 fps      |
| 4K         | 120, 60, 30, 24 fps      |
| 5.3K       | 60, 30, 24 fps           |

**3\. Frame Rate of the Shot**

When shooting slow-motion recordings, the video frame rate is the most critical factor to consider. The higher the video frame rate, the greater the amount of time you may slow down the video without harming its overall quality.

You'll get cinematic scenes at typical rates when you film a video at a high frame rate, such as 24 or 30 frames per second. In contrast, the result will be less than pleasing if you try to slow down the film with such frame rates.

Increase the frame rate to, for example, 60 frames per second, and you will be able to slow the film down by up to 2x (to obtain 30 frames per second) while still getting a professional-looking clip.

Similarly, the film captured at 120 frames per second may be slowed down by up to four times. Two hundred forty frames per second are recommended for people who wish to capture super-slow-motion film. If you shoot at such a high frame rate, you'll be able to slow down the film by an incredible 8x.
