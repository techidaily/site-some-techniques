![polaroid-cube-plus-vs-gopro-hero4-session.jpg ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/polaroid-cube-plus-vs-gopro-hero4-session.jpg)

 Polaroid Cube+ is developed with much simpler design as compared to GoPro. You can control photos as well as videos from a single button on the top - press it one time to capture stills and twice to record videos. One more button is available for Wi-Fi control that also assists in making connection with Cube+ application. You will find a Micro-USB slot and MicroSD card slot behind the door.

#### 2.Battery and Charging

If you keep your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on and capture 8MP photos once/second then this battery will work up to 3 hour 35 minutes. For Cube+, the battery will serve you up to 1.5 hours even if you have Wi-Fi in ON position. You can charge its battery via Micro USB port using a simple USB power pack, computer or AC-USB Adapter.

For taking stills you can easily switch between 3MP, 6Mp and 8MP where automatic exposure effect leads to much impressive results in daylight.
