![imported media file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/best-background-music-for-exercise-22.jpg)

##### Step3Add Audio/Music to the Video

Next, see an option for audio located at the top. Although Filmora comes with a music library where you can find royalty-free music, here, you need to import media you've just downloaded to your computer.

![add music to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/best-background-music-for-exercise-23.jpg)

So click on My Music, located in the vertical menu on the left side, to import your file. For example, you can see If I Can't Have You by Shawn Mendes in the image.

![add music to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/best-background-music-for-exercise-24.jpg)

##### Step4Adjust the Background Music

Last but not least, adjusting audio to your fitness video is crucial to make it visually attractive. You can trim and adjust the audio to align the song with your video's length. In addition, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows you to keep an eye on the fine-tuned preview window while you're still working on your video.

![adjust the background music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/best-background-music-for-exercise-25.jpg)

You can also double-click the audio file to access the audio editing panel. This panel will let you edit your audio, such as adjust volume, set up an audio equalizer, fade-in/fade-out, etc. It also enables you to adjust audio speed to create a fast or slow-motion effect.

Once you're done with video editing, click on the "export" and choose whatever file format you want from the pop-up window.

## Final Words

In conclusion, the music you listen to is vital. It's a great way to get motivated and focused. Many people use background music to get themselves going in the morning. This can also be helpful when trying to focus and block out distracting sounds during a stressful situation.

We've compiled the best background music above for working out and yoga for you. They are a perfect mix of beats and bpm for keeping you in the zone and motivated. So download, listen, and choose which one works best for you.

In addition, I'd recommend that you try to keep your background music to an even volume throughout the class. The last thing you want is for you to get distracted or feel annoyed. And if you're looking for more motivation, try listening to motivational quotes or inspirational speeches before and after your workout.
