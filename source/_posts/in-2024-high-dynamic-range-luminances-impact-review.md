1. HDR Processing

Luminance HDR separates the processing of HDR images into two phases: The creation of HDR images and its conversion to an LDR image. The creation and tone mapping of HDR images are interactive using GUI, and images can be enhanced using quality features. The image loading speed is quite fair.

Also, you can utilize ‘Portable' mode to put the Luminous HDR application on a USB stick with its settings.
