Rating 4.3 / 5

HDR Lab is another website with some fantastic sky HDR images. With multiple locations, different sun angles, clouds, and a wide range of colors, you will surely find what you are looking for here. HDR lab is precisely what the name suggests. It contains all the tools and tutorials needed to start working on HDR images.

The images are not too complex, making them perfect for beginners. HDR lab will introduce you to the future of imaging, taking you step by step, especially for young digital artists.

**Our Verdict**

However, the website does not have a very intuitive interface, even though it is easy to navigate. The ads that pop up might get frustrating and distracting after a while. Apart from that, the images are directly downloaded into your computer without you first having a look at them, making it difficult to choose if you want to look at multiple pictures before deciding on one.

While they all might be sky images, no two images are alike. With varying degrees of colors, locations, and angles, each of them has a separate charm. Also, clouds are probably the highlight of each image, and the coloring makes them look heavenly.

**Our Verdict**

Free images allow you to access all these HDR images and download them directly to your computer. The interface is much like Google Images, allowing you to scroll through the gallery and find the best shots for your work.
