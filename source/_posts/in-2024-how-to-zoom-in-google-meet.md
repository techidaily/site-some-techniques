## Part 3\. Tips and tricks to use Google Meet

To maintain your attention on the primary speaker without straining your eyes, all you have to do is pin them to the top row of your grid.
* Google Meet has you covered whether you want to record a meeting for posterity, share a copy of it with coworkers who couldn't make it, or refer to it afterwards. All you have to do to start recording meetings is choose that option from the three-dot menu at the bottom of the screen.

It is exclusively offered in English. Click Turn on Captions in the Meet's bottom right corner to turn it on.
