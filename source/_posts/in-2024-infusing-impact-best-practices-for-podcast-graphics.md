### Where to use

You can think of your podcast logo as a representation of your brand. Your podcast logo will be visible on all your podcast covers. You can also use your logo on websites and when you market your products.

### When to use

## Part 2\. Do I Need a Logo for My Podcast?

Many users feel that visuals are a minor aspect of podcasts and often overlook it. It's true that podcasts mainly consist of audio, but a visual representation is just as important. Let's go over why having a good podcast logo is crucial.

* Sets the first impression for new listeners.
* Boost the credibility of your work in the eyes of the audience.
* Required by most major podcast publishing platforms.
