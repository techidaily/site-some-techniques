 Hardware encoders are specially designed processors and they follow specific algorithms to collect streamable content from encoded videos. These encoders usually come in variable size ranges as portable boxes, smaller units or larger permanent type fixtures; all of them have different capabilities.

 The hardware type encoders are usually heavily priced and recommended for professional broadcasters. This category of encoders’ offers fixed video quality and users cannot make additional adjustments for its parameters. Hardware encoders demand much time for designing process as well as at development stage; you may often find few with older hardware components installed inside.

 It is not possible to get a hardware encoder for free but they can be collected at low price tag. Many advanced encoders are priced below $100 whereas few highly professional designs are costlier. Note that, as hardware encoders have fixed set of arrangements to perform encoding process so they perform with higher speed as compared to software based encoders.
