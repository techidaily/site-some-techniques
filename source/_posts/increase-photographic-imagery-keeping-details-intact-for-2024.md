Resizing images is a routine step during the photo editing process. The size of all photos is often reduced in order to make a picture better suited for use on social media. On the other hand, enlarging a photo can be more complicated than it sounds. Increasing the overall number of pixels in a photo can easily cause pixelization, especially if the original photo was in low resolution. Blurriness, JPEG compression artifacts or image noise are also among frequent unwanted side effects of blowing up digital images.

Choosing the right software can help you avoid the potential dangers of enlarging images, which is the reason why we are going to take you through some of the best online as well as Mac and PC-based image enlargers.

## Enlarging Photos Online Without Compromising Quality

The resolution of an image determines how much that image can be enlarged without losing any quality. For instance, if the photo’s resolution is 600x400 pixels, trying to increase it up to 4000x3000 pixels can cause **blurriness or pixelization**. Let’s have a look at some of the best online tools for enlarging low-resolution photos, without compromising their quality.

#### 1. [PhotoEnlarger](https://www.photoenlarger.com/)

**Price:** Free

![ best image enlarger ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoenlarger-image-larger.jpg)

The largest resolution of a photo you can upload to PhotoEnlarger is limited to 1920X1080 pixels, which makes this tool perfectly suited for blowing up images that are relatively small in size. In order to import a photo, you can click on the Browse icon and navigate to the folder on your computer where the picture is stored or you can simply drag and drop the file to the **Select Image to Enlarge** area of the tool’s page. **The Scale** value is going to be set to **200%** by default, which means that your image is going to be **doubled in size**, and the PhotoEnlarger platform lets make your photo up to **four times larger than the original**. After selecting the Scale value or inserting new values into the **Width and Height boxes** you just have to click on the **Enlarge button** and wait for the picture to be enlarged. The four versions of the picture in different sizes are going to be generated you can crop each of them and download them.

If the original file had a width value of 1200 pixels you can double it to 2400 pixels without any risk of quality loss. The **height value** will be **adjusted automatically** if the Keep Aspect Ratio option is enabled. The new size of the photo will be displayed at the bottom of the screen. Directly above it is the **Resize button**, click on it and then click on the **Download Image button** to save a photo to a hard drive.

Changing the size of a photo in the Adobe’s highly praised photo editor is a simple task since you just have to go to the Image drop-down menu, and select the Image Size option.

## FAQ: Discover More about Image Enlargers

#### 1\. How do I make a picture bigger without losing quality?

It is pretty easy. All you need is a high-quality image enlarger. We recommend online tools like PhotoEnlarger and ResizeImage because they are free yet excellent. Besides, you can choose to download some software like PhotoZoom or Reshade Image Resizer to enlarge images without losing quality.

#### 2\. Why are my photos blurry when I zoom in?

Digital images consist of pixels. When enlarging the pictures, the pixels get extended too much to fit the large dimensions, so the photos become blurry.

#### 3\. How do I shrink a photo?

Just as the way of enlarging a photo, you need a tool to resize images. All you have to do is follow the instructions of the software.
