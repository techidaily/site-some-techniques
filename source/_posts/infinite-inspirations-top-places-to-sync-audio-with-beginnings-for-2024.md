## Part 1\. What Kind of Music Can You Use for the Podcast Intro?

Various types of music can be used for podcast intros, including creative common music, royalty-free music, and public domain music. So, whether you're looking to use vocals or special music as an intro for your podcast show, it's crucial you understand these different types of music, as it'll save you from violating copyright laws that could compromise your podcast show's reputation online.

**Creative Common Music (Free to use)**

Creative Common Music is music tracks where the artist gives users 100% freedom to use it without permission. It's a type of music with no copyright. But you might be required to provide credit to the artist. So please read the terms and conditions attached to any creative common music before using it.

**Royalty-Free Music (Paid)**

Royalty-Free Music is the opposite of Creative Common Music. To use such music, you need to have a subscription on the website or make a one-time payment to have 100% right to use it in your podcast intro. In addition, such music is usually subjected to copyright. So, using it without permission will risk your podcast show's reputation.

**Public Domain Music (Free to use)**

Public Domain Music is music with an expired copyright license published in a public domain where you can use them for free without permission or giving credit. For example, in the United States, music works published in 1926 or earlier are Public Domain Music.

## Part 2\. 10 Places To Get Music for Your Podcast Intros

A professional-sounding podcast starts with intro music and uses songs to move the story forward. Now you have a brief understanding of the kind of music you can use for a podcast intro, let's dive into the list of the top 10 places to get music for your podcast intro.

### 1\. [YouTube Audio Library](https://www.audiolibrary.com.co/)

![places to find music for podcast intro youtube audio library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-1.jpg)

Many users are unaware that YouTube also has one of the biggest collections of royalty-free music that you can download and use for creative or artistic purposes. YouTube Audio Library allows you to search for royalty-free music by mood, track name, artist, or genre. So, regardless of the topic or theme of your podcast, you will find something suitable in its vast library.

Plus, you do not need any registrations or have to answer long questionnaires to access royalty-free music for podcast intros from the YouTube library. Instead, you can use the existing YouTube account to search, download, and use the music available on the platform.

**Pros and Cons of YouTube Audio Library**

 Pros

* You can find music representing different themes, genres, moods, cultures, and so on.
* You can listen to the music on YouTube Audio Library or YouTube, SoundCloud, Apple Music, or Spotify.
* You do not have to open an account or sign up.
* YouTube Audio Library has one of the biggest collections of royalty-free music.

![places to find music for podcast intro dig ccmixter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-2.jpg)

Another free platform, Dig CCmixter, is a community-supported platform that accepts music from musicians and allows users to download them for free. You do not have to tag the musician who created and uploaded the track to the Dig CCmixter library. An open internet utility, Dig CCmixter, does not even ask you to register on the site.

You can use tags to look for specific music genres and get a short list of types of music you need for your podcast. However, the Dig CCmixter site is unsecured; it isn't a big concern, but most browsers (depending on your Settings) won't allow you to access the site.

Still, if you can access the Dig CCmixter site, you will have one of the largest collections of royalty-free music that you can use to create podcast intros and outros.

**Pros and Cons of Dig CCmixter:**

 Pros

* You can use music for free as long as you give credit.
* Broad music collection.

 Cons

* The search functionality could be better.
* The website's interface looks outdated.

**Ratings and User Reviews of Dig CCmixter for Android:**

* **G2 Rating:** 7/ 5 (1 million+ user reviews)
* **Trustpilot:** 3/ 5 (726K user reviews)
* **TrustRadius**: 4.7/ 5 (400K+ user reviews)

**User Review**: "YouTube Audio Library has always satisfied all my music needs. The best thing: you do not need to pay even a dime to use professional-sounding music."

![places to find music for podcast intro freemusicarchive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-3.jpg)

You can find a piece of suitable music for podcast intros that will intrigue your users, from rock, jazz, reggae, or electronic. Another essential thing about Free Music Archive is that it gives you access to premium music service providers.

### 4\. [StockMusic](https://stockmusic.net/) – Subscription and track based

![places to find music for podcast intro stockmusic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-4.jpg)

StochMusic has a simple concept, and it sells you music royalty in exchange for a subscription. For as little as US$ 16.69/mo, you can download as many soundtracks as you want for podcast intros.

StockMusic charges money for the music and sound effects because, unlike YouTube Audio Library and Free Music Archive, StockMusic includes music only from professionals. So, the music you get in return for your money is subpar and sounds professional.

* Get a license for the music that you purchase on StockMusic and monetize. You can also sell the music to other parties. Transfer the license to someone else via the platform.
* Clean and simple user interface. The site is mobile-responsive, which works well even on mobile devices.

 Cons

* Before downloading music from the site, you must register and subscribe to a plan.

**Ratings and User Reviews of Free Music Archive for Android:**

Many users are unaware that YouTube also has one of the biggest collections of royalty-free music that you can download and use for creative or artistic purposes. YouTube Audio Library allows you to search for royalty-free music by mood, track name, artist, or genre. So, regardless of the topic or theme of your podcast, you will find something suitable in its vast library.

Plus, you do not need any registrations or have to answer long questionnaires to access royalty-free music for podcast intros from the YouTube library. Instead, you can use the existing YouTube account to search, download, and use the music available on the platform.

![places to find music for podcast intro dig ccmixter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-2.jpg)

Another free platform, Dig CCmixter, is a community-supported platform that accepts music from musicians and allows users to download them for free. You do not have to tag the musician who created and uploaded the track to the Dig CCmixter library. An open internet utility, Dig CCmixter, does not even ask you to register on the site.

You can use tags to look for specific music genres and get a short list of types of music you need for your podcast. However, the Dig CCmixter site is unsecured; it isn't a big concern, but most browsers (depending on your Settings) won't allow you to access the site.

Still, if you can access the Dig CCmixter site, you will have one of the largest collections of royalty-free music that you can use to create podcast intros and outros.

**Pros and Cons of Dig CCmixter:**

![places to find music for podcast intro freemusicarchive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-3.jpg)

Free Music Archive, as the name indicates, is another site that presents free music for podcast intros and outro's from independent creators and musicians worldwide.

You can find a piece of suitable music for podcast intros that will intrigue your users, from rock, jazz, reggae, or electronic. Another essential thing about Free Music Archive is that it gives you access to premium music service providers.

![places to find music for podcast intro stockmusic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-4.jpg)

StochMusic has a simple concept, and it sells you music royalty in exchange for a subscription. For as little as US$ 16.69/mo, you can download as many soundtracks as you want for podcast intros. There is another subscription plan which also gives you access to unlimited sound effects besides soundtracks. Soundtracks are suitable for podcast creators looking to add podcast intros.

At the same time, the second plan will be helpful to creators that create story-based podcasts where sound effects add drama to voice and intrigue your users. StockMusic charges money for the music and sound effects because, unlike YouTube Audio Library and Free Music Archive, StockMusic includes music only from professionals. So, the music you get in return for your money is subpar and sounds professional.

**Pros and Cons of StockMusic**

 Pros

* Filter by genre, mood, instruments, duration, and more to search for soundtracks and audio effects.
* Get a license for the music that you purchase on StockMusic and monetize. You can also sell the music to other parties. Transfer the license to someone else via the platform.
* Clean and simple user interface. The site is mobile-responsive, which works well even on mobile devices.

 Cons

* Before downloading music from the site, you must register and subscribe to a plan.

**Ratings and User Reviews of Free Music Archive for Android:**

* **G2 Rating: 3.6/5 (400 user reviews)**
* **User Review: "**Free Music Archive makes life easier by giving me access to different types of music I need for my content."

## Legal Tips For Podcast Intro Music

Good podcast intro music does not necessarily mean you have to pay an astronomically high price. On the contrary, you can get music for podcast intros even for free without crediting the musician. However, it is essential to understand how to avoid legal troubles. In other words, understand what is considered legal and illegal or illegitimate use.

Retain that even using non-copyrighted music can sometimes land you in legal trouble, so it is better to know how to avoid it when using non-copyrighted or copyrighted music. Here are the factors that you should always consider when choosing to include any piece in your podcast:

* **Always get permission in writing and transfer or license.** Even when you are using royalty-free music for podcast intros, ensure to have some written proof that you've received permission to use the track in your podcast.
* **Ensure that the transfer license or written permission covers the publisher and creators' names to avoid legal troubles.** Usually, royalty-free music providers bundle all these details together, so you are fine. Still, ensure that the transfer license includes this information.
* **If your podcast plays worldwide, you will need permission from the authors to use the music in all countries.** Otherwise, the use of music can be subjected to perpetuity. That is, you might have permission to use the music tracks in some parts of the world but not the entire world. So, ensure to take permission to use the music track worldwide.
* **Don't use a music track multiple times, even if you have received permission to use it only once.** These distinctions are crucial to specify.
* **Remember the terms and conditions mentioned on the royalty-free music distribution services.** For instance, some Creative Commons licenses come with the situation that you must credit the creator. In case you violate the rule, the music will be considered copyrighted.
* **When you take music from a freelancer, or it is personally made for your podcast on a special request by you, ensure that the creator owns all the rights.** In several cases, podcast creators have had to pay for the freelancer's mistakes. You can sign a contract with the freelancer and ensure that it is composed initially, not copied from some other music.
