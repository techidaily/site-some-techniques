## Initiate Impact: A Strategic Blueprint for Setting Up a Tech Reviews Channel

Nowadays people don't have time to read through text-based product reviews and often feel that written reviews could be manipulated. They prefer to watch videos as opposed to reading text-based review. The demand for good review is high with companies and business looking to get reviews of their product on YouTube through popular reviewer.

YouTube is the second largest search engine after Google and has a billion users a month. This makes YouTube an attractive platform to post product reviews and build trust with consumers.

Good product review videos give that last push to your potential customers to buy the product you are endorsing. Lastly feedback from these reviews will help your viewers to either purchase or not.

Product review video creation thus became profitable career for many, so in this article will guide you to create excellent products review channel.

When creating a YouTube channel, you need to make sure that you have all the equipment needed to start making the content you have chosen which is the product review video. If you are really determined to create one, you don't need to buy expensive vlogging equipment right away, you can use what you have now if the video is clear and the audio is good.

## What are the things needed to make a quality video?

**Camera for video:** If you only have your smart phone, that's good to go if the video is working

**Good Lighting:** Open window for the natural sunlight to come in, better to make video around 8am to 10am you will get the good sunlight that time. But there is affordable ring light in the online shop that you can purchased. Most content creator use right light for steady light and proper video lighting

**Stand/Tripod:** Tripod used if you have digital camera and you can use phone stand for your mobile phone for steady video. There is also affordable stand that you can buy online

**Lapel Microphone:** Use lapel microphone that can be connected even if you are using mobile phone for vlogging. This can make your audio quality good and clear.

**Place/Studio:** Find extra space in your room where you can sit to vlog properly. Also look for a good background, one that doesn't grab the viewers' attention much better to use plain background.

**Products:** Products that you will make a review, the one that you think you can stand until the end. Like for example you can change the brand of the products but you should stick to that type of product, like if you want to talk about Tech then you will do all reviews about Tech, if it's about skin care product then all the reviews should also be done about skin care.

## Things to consider to start Product Review Channel

### **Create a YouTube Channel**

Before you do a product review, you need to create a YouTube channel where you can post the product review videos you made. There you can get paid for the videos you made thru Google Adsense when your channel is Monetized. But if you're just starting out, don't think that you'll make money right away, because it's not that easy. Before you can earn on YouTube you must first pass the requirements that YouTube asks for you to become a partner, it is to have 1,000 Subscriber and 4,000 watch hours.

![select right product to review](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/select-right-product-to-review.jpg)

However, it's important to note that even from there, YouTube will still evaluate your channel for other strict criteria to make sure it is complying with all their policies and best practices outside of watch time and watch hours minimums.

For now, just do you job and create a quality video to soon be monetized.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **Kind of Products to Review**

Start by reviewing products you have, because nobody is going to give out a free product to someone who's never uploaded a review. Of course, it's important from the starts you really need to invest in the product you want to review, so you can start a video reviewing product on your channel if that's the content you've chosen.

![decide product review type](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/decide-product-review-type.jpg)

For the Brand to notice your video, buy some of their products that you think useful to you and make a review about it, make sure to make a video review creative to stands out to another reviewer. So that when the Brands see your video they will be amazed by at your work. But just make sure that the product your reviewing is approved to or you don't have any issue with the products, because remember it's not just the Brand eyeing to your work but the viewers are also looking for such a review.

When you have a lot of product review video on you channel, other Brands will approach you to offer you to do a review on their product and sometime they also offer payment. But they only offer the payment when they think it's worth it or they get some sales. In regard with this I'm talking about your community or Subscribers count, because Brands only offer payment for your video if you have stable or more subscribers' count. So, if you don't have many subscribers yet, you need to work hard to increase your viewers and patient is more important in this kind of field.

I recommend sticking with the same kind of products and specialize so that the viewers will familiar that you are the one doing that kind of review. They know immediately whose channel they should search of they ever need your review.

### **Script about the Products**

Here is some basic information on how you make a quality script

1. The basic information about the products example the price, size, ingredients and or materials
2. Where you got
3. What you liked about the products
4. What you didn't like
5. Worth to buy or not
6. Recommendation or your personal thoughts about the product

Just like product demo videos, product review videos also need a proper script before recording so that you cover everything that you want to without missing any key aspects of the product that you're reviewing. Keep the review short and to the point because potential customers have come to your channel to watch the review of the product in the market. Concentrate on the products and explain the features in detail to help users determine if the products suit them. You can add your opinion to humanize the product features. As an Influencer, the main purpose of doing product review is to get people to buy the products you feature. You need to build credibly with customers for them to buy what you recommend. To achieve this, you need to give your genuine review by highlight the pros and cons of the product. This will get you the potential customer or subscriber who will happy to buy the products you are endorsing.

### **Good Editing**

Editing is important if you want to look good. People don't like to watch long boring video so try making video short crisp and try a good reliable video editing software. I recommend you **[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora** got the right solution to record high-quality product review video, let's your record videos at 4k HD resolution.

## Conclusion

Even though the company want influencers to be fair and honest, they also expect a relatively positive review since they're paying the influencers for their time. Many viewers on necessarily don't care if a video is sponsored or not, they mainly want creator to give a useful opinion. The most important part of those process is to be patient. Expect it to take a months before get notice of people, getting subscriber is complicated and you feel like giving up, but the more reviews you have, the better. Thus, in the beginning you won't make anything until you put in the work, but you can see how you can go from 0 subscribers or views to 1000 once you build up a nice content, all from your single YouTube channel. Remember that give your best in every video you make because one day your hard work will pay off. Best of Luck!
