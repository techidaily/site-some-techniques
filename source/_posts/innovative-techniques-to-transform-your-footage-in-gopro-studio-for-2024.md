#### 1\. **Importing videos**

![Import videos in gopro studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-1.jpg)

#### 2\. **Trimming**

 After you have imported the videos, cut the unnecessary portion of the videos that you are not interested to include, this trimming or cutting should be done before you start the actual editing.  
For that, click on the thumbnails of the videos and then on "play". This will result into playing the video. There are two trimming buttons on the left of the window that you can use for marking the beginning and ending of the clip which you want to include. In this way, you can select the number of videos clips that you want to include in your video.

![Trimming videos in gopro studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-2.jpg)

#### 3\. **Changing video settings**

 If you want to change any setting like frames per second, size of the video, change format, increasing speed or any other setting; you can go to advanced settings and make the changes. Don't forget to click on "remember setting" button after you have made the settings otherwise it will not save the settings that you would have made.

#### 4\. **Adding files to convert list**

 Now, you need to add the roughly trimmed files to the conversion list so that you can start with the editing. For that select the clip and then, go to "Add Clip To Conversion List". In this way, add all the clips one by one to the list and they will appear on the right column of the GoPro window when added.

Once you have added all the clips to conversion list, convert them by clicking on "Convert All" button.

![hwo to use gopro studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-4.jpg)

#### 5\. **Adding Title**
