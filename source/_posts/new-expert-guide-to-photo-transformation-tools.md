### Step 9\

### How to Distort a Picture Using an Online Tool

You can also distort a pic using an online tool. A distortion website allows you to morph and add noise to your image. These online tools offer multiple photo distortion filters and effects that you can add to your image and distort its look. After applying a filter, you can manually adjust the intensity of your distortion filter to suit your preferences.

Some of the images you can distort using online tools include:

* Over-Exposition: This is when the person in the photo is too bright or overexposed to show the subject's features.
* Under-Exposure: This is when the person in the photo is too dark or under-exposed to show the subject's features.
* Visual Stretching is when you digitally stretch an image to the desired size, sometimes using a "zoom" feature to get closer or broader shots of the subject.

Photomosh.com is one of the online tools that people use to edit images online. You can use it to distort photos to create new visual content that showcases your creativity and personality; this website is user-friendly and allows you to create your photo distortion quickly.

### How to Distort a Picture on Mobile

Uploading pics on social media is exciting. But sometimes it can be boring if you display the same expression numerous times. Luckily, there are many distorted face apps for iOS and Android mobile devices.

Playing with expressions can be enough to create funny photos. Sometimes a face distortion app is what you need to produce unique images for a different purpose, including annoying close people, jokes, and memes. A distorted face app can turn a pic into an unrecognizable image after completely editing it.

Photo Warp is one of the best distortion apps for Android and iOS devices. The app allows you to get more creative with your pics.

With just one click, you can buff your face up, make yourself thinner, or enlarge any part of the image. The best part is: The pic you produce will have high resolution to allow you to upload them on various social media platforms without fear of not being optimal or broken.
