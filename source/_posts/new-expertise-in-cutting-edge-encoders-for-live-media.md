 Hardware encoders are specially designed processors and they follow specific algorithms to collect streamable content from encoded videos. These encoders usually come in variable size ranges as portable boxes, smaller units or larger permanent type fixtures; all of them have different capabilities.

 The hardware type encoders are usually heavily priced and recommended for professional broadcasters. This category of encoders’ offers fixed video quality and users cannot make additional adjustments for its parameters. Hardware encoders demand much time for designing process as well as at development stage; you may often find few with older hardware components installed inside.

 It is not possible to get a hardware encoder for free but they can be collected at low price tag. Many advanced encoders are priced below $100 whereas few highly professional designs are costlier. Note that, as hardware encoders have fixed set of arrangements to perform encoding process so they perform with higher speed as compared to software based encoders.

## Top Live Streaming Hardware Encoders

### 1. VidiU:

 VidiU is able to stream data to almost every online video platform with ease and it has native integration with few popular social media networks like Twithc, Ustream, Periscope, YouTube Live etc so that users can enjoy seamless streaming with quick services. One latest addition to services is in form of sharelink and it is offered by Teradek. It is dedicated to bring a high class professional bonding service for VidiU Pro. Once users enable this technology on their workspace then it can easily combine bandwidth from various potential networks so that upload speed can be immediately boosted.

 The best thing to know wbout VidiU is its cable free capabilities that allow users to monitor their live streams from remote locations using tablet or smart phones. Users can easily send data of all live broadcasts to SD card for future needs.

### 2. Beam:

 Beam works on 5GHz unlicensed band so it can easily work up to maximum distance of 2500 Ft. It is designed to work with pristine video quality that utilized  compression format and supports 15 Mbps streaming with wireless link. The frame latency of 2 is observed but when you connect beam to a LAN platform then it can offer 30Mbps streaming rate. This platform is particularly designed to meet the end requirements of professionals and it works for easy integration between all professional cameras.

 The best part to know is its multicast capability where users can connect about 4 receivers at a time and feeds can be transferred to numbers of destinations at a time even without losing any content or without causing any delay on network.

**Price:** You can access the Beam package with payment of $4,990.00 and it includes both transmitter and receiver.
