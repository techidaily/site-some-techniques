Story Remix has 3 major sections namely, media bin consists of files already included in your card-based timeline and files that you chose in previous steps; preview section with recent changes and timeline shows the card with a running video; and the timeline having the option to drag and drop cards from the media bin.

2. You can select one theme from the listed options namely, "No theme", "Adventure", "Chilled", "Classic", "Electric", "Joy" and "Loved". Preview the selected theme and if satisfied, click on "Done".

## Part 5: How to add 3D effects to a Story Remix project

Adding 3D special effects to video clips is one of the lucrative features of Photos app.

1. You can add 3D effects by selecting the clip in timeline and clicking the ‘3D effects’ button.
2. Position the effect by dragging/dropping and via preview panel > set the time range for effect > adjust the Y and Z co-ordinates for the effect. Some of the effects are applicable to the whole clip, while some are meant to be placed at particular locations over the clip. Slide on the ‘Attach to a point’ toggle, so it makes the effect move or stay fixed, depending on the object it is fixed to.
3. Click ‘Delete’ if you want to remove 3D effects. Hit ‘Done’ for saving the changes.
