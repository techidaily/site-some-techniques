Step 6: Drag to the timeline above the footage you are working on. You'll see a small blurred area in the middle of your preview screen.

Step 7: Before adjusting anything, you need to lock your main tracks; this will ensure that you cannot accidentally move them.

Step 9: Click on the blurred mosaic layer and go to the upper left side of your screen, where you'll see that you have some options that allow you to adjust your blur effect.

Step 10: You'll see six different Mosaics that you can choose from; select the pixelated option. Choosing this option will immediately pixelate the face with the mosaic layer.
