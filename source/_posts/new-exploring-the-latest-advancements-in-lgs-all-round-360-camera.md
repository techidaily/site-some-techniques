## Part 3 Pros and Cons at a glance

Before buying a new device, we often prefer to go through its pros and cons so that a better decision can be made on time. Below are some important details about pros and cons of LG 360 degree camera unit:

| Pros                                                                             | Cons                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Less costly as compared to all other competitors                                 | You need a desktop application to upload videos in 360 degree format                                                                                                              |

| Small size – can be easily kept in pocket                                        | Weak VR ecosystem: You have to download photos and videos before you watch them on computer; Photos cannot be edited – not in desktop app as well as not in mobile version of app |
| It is possible to use only one lens if you wish to work on non 360 degree videos | Software glitches                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Compatible with android and iOS                                                  | Battery is not swappable                                                                                                                                                          |
| Limited sharing capabilities for photos and videos                               |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Do not have water resistant body Internal storage space is not usable            |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
