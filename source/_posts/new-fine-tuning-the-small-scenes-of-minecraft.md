## Way 1\. Change FOV in Options

Although the PC version of Minecraft doesn't come with a built-in zoom in or out feature, you may change the field of view to suit your tastes. A higher field of view setting will allow you to see more in a single frame, but everything will look a little bit smaller. A zoomed-in display is possible by lowering the field of vision and limiting the number of objects you can see.

Step1 To access the in-game menu, launch a game and hit the Esc key on your keyboard.

Step2 In the game menu, choose the Options... button.

![minecraft game menu options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/minecraft-game-menu-options.jpg)

Step3 Now, use the slider to alter your range of vision. The slider will be positioned in the center by default. To get a closer look at your surroundings, click on it and move it to the left of your screen. However, moving the FOV slider all the way to the left also means that you won't be able to see as much during gameplay.

![minecraft fov button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/minecraft-fov-button.jpg)

Step4 To save the new FOV settings after finishing adjusting the slider and being satisfied with the field of vision, click Done at the bottom of the page.

Step5 Now, after the successful zoom in on Minecraft, press Backspace to get into the menu and to continue playing, choose "Return to Game."

## Way 2\. Change FOV in Options

You may utilize the accessibility features in mac OS to get a zooming option while altering your FOV. You may reach the Minecraft window by manually adjusting the zoom in and out. To zoom in or out instead, utilize macOS' accessibility zoom function. By just dragging your mouse while holding a certain key, you may zoom in or out in any program or game window. Here's how to activate it and utilize it:

**Steps to Zoom in on Minecraft on MacOS:**

## Way 3\. Using OptiFine Mod (Java)

You may customize the zoom in and out of your Minecraft environment by using the OptiFine plugin. On your computer, you must install the necessary applications.

This mod only works with Java Edition on operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux. For Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, Minecraft for mobile devices, and Minecraft for gaming consoles, this mod is not accessible.

## Way 4\. Using a Spyglass

In Minecraft, the spyglass is used to zoom in so that a player may see well at a greater distance than is typically feasible. This is incredibly helpful while exploring diverse biomes since it enhances your eyesight and makes it simple to find monsters or precious materials that are hidden from view. Players may now create a zooming item in Minecraft. The new Spyglass item that enables users to zoom in on certain places was introduced to Minecraft in the 1.17 release. The spyglass is a creatable item in Minecraft that enables users to alter their Field of Vision anytime they want to without visiting the settings page. On your Minecraft crafting table, you may create a spyglass.

Step1 Create a Spyglass by following the newest version guide of Minecraft.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![create a spyglass](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-spyglass.jpg)

Step2 After that, put the Spyglass you just created in your menu bar and take a hold of it. When you use it, your eyesight will enlarge the area you are focusing on. The same effect as altering your FoV in the settings is achieved with this, but it is faster, simpler, and has more zooming. You cannot lower the FoV setting below 30 by altering it in the menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![spyglass options panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/spyglass-options-panel.jpg)

Step3 However, you will always zoom in to 10% of your current Field of View while using your Spyglass. When using a spyglass, for instance, your zoom level will be 6 if your field of view is set to 60\. As a result, a Spyglass will allow you to see objects considerably further away.

## Way 5\. Use Zoomed-Out Maps

You might think about making a zoomed-out map of your planet in addition to providing a mod to zoom in for simpler navigation. The map may be useful for several reasons, including returning to a certain area, such as your home base. When playing Minecraft, you can make a map and utilize it to gain a zoomed-out perspective of your world.

Step1 Gather the materials needed to make a map in the first step. These include a compass, a crafts table, and sugar cane (used to make paper).

![use zoom out maps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-out-maps.jpg)

Step2 Nine sheets of paper will be made from the sugar cane. Open the crafting table, and then put three pieces of sugar cane on each of the bottom squares to make them. To add paper to your inventory, click and drag it to the right-hand box's paper icon.

Step3 At this point, we may start drawing a map. Put the compass in the center square of the handicraft grid, then fill up all the other squares with paper. Now that the crafts grid is open, fill each square with paper and set a compass in the center. To add the yellow piece of paper to the inventory, click and drag it over to the right.

Step4 In order to utilize the map, choose it from the Equip bar at the bottom of the game screen, then right-click (or press and hold on a mobile device). After the first time, repeat the instructions to build 2048 x 2048 blocks, which will give you the greatest magnification.
