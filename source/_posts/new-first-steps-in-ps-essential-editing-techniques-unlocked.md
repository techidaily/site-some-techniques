## Part 1: 10 Useful Photoshop Photo Editing Tips for Beginners

Have you ever used Photoshop to edit your images? If you are a beginner, read this section to get aware of 10 valuable tips for Photoshop photo editing.

### 1\. Tip 1: Sky Replacement

Do you know that Photoshop image editing can easily replace the sky in your picture with a single click? To use this feature, navigate to "Edit" and then click on "Sky Replacement." This feature will open its dialog box from which you can easily choose the sky displayed in the "Sky List."
