**Pros:** This software is free and compatible with Mac as well as Windows.

**Cons:** Videos get compressed during this editing process. Also the large videos demand more time in uploading process.

 Because YouTube Video Editor is no longer available after September 20, 2017, if you are finding an alternative to YouTube video editor, you can get some information from the [ultimate guide to YouTube video editing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

**Note:** GoPro Hero5 added the digital image stabilization feature, you can turn this option on while recording videos, which can reduce the video shaky to some degree.
