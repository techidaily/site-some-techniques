## 1\. History of Final Cut Pro

The journey of Final Cut Pro(FCP) began as an alternative to Adobe Premiere Pro. FCP was initially developed by Macromedia. The designer of FCP named Randy Ubillos used to work for Adobe Premiere previously. In 1998, Apple purchased the development team of Final Cut Pro. Hence, Macromedia FCP turned into Apple FCP.

The popularity of Final Cut Pro started to pick up in the early 2000s. A popular movie producer named Michael Bloom praised FCP to boost its popularity. The software did not crash even once during rendering a movie. Soon, the popular director Roger Avery became the spokesperson for Apple FCP. This encouraged video creators and producers to try out Final Cut Pro as a video editor.

The breakthrough came in 2002 when Final Cut Pro was awarded a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award. Final Cut Express was launched in 2003 at an affordable rate. But it was discontinued in 2011\. This is because Apple launched Final Cut Pro X in April 2011.

Final Cut Pro X came with a new user interface and workflow. It was packed with loads of new features. Subsequently, new features such as effects, filters, color enhancement, and support for HDR and 360-degree video were introduced. This helped it to become one of the best video editors in the world.

Now that we have reviewed Final Cut Pro thoroughly, it is time to illustrate how to use Final Cut Pro. The learning curve of Final Ct Pro is steep and the user interface is not highly intuitive. That is why you need to go through tutorials to get the steps correct for the video editor. Here are the steps on how to edit a video with Final Cut X.

Step 1: Download and install Final Cut Pro. Launch the application and you will be asked for certain permissions. Allow them to open Final Cut Pro for the first time.

Step 2: Go to File> New> Project. Name your project and select Use Automatic Settings to get started. Go to File> Import> Media and bring in the video clips that you want to edit. You will see the thumbnails of the imported video clips under the Browser of FCP.
