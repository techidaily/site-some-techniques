## How to Change the Netflix Video Playback Speed on Computer and Mobile?

Users are now able to pick the speed at which they wish to view anything on their tablet or smartphone, thanks to the playback options introduced by Netflix. To accommodate slowed-down viewing, Netflix enables anybody using an Android smartphone to watch at speeds of either 0.5x or 0.75x for slowed-down viewing or 1.25x or 1.5x for quicker viewing.

These are somewhat fewer possibilities than YouTube, which enables users to slow things down to 0.25x rates and speed them up to double the average playing speed, among other things. Playback speed settings are also accessible for movies that have been downloaded and saved for offline streaming by the viewer. To learn **How to Change Netflix Playback Speed**, follow this easy guide.

## Part 1: How to Change the Netflix Video Playback Speed On Computer?

As mentioned above, you either want to switch things up in terms of video playback speed because you're bored, or you're eager to find out about the outcomes of the plot twists. Either way, the Netflix playback speed feature serves its purpose greatly because it satisfies both kinds of audiences. To learn how to do this on your computer, follow the steps below:

**Step 1:** Browse the **Netflix website** on your computers, sign in to your account, and choose a TV program or movie to stream from the list that appears.

**Step 2:** When the movie has finished loading and is ready to be played, **drag your pointer** to the bottom of the display to display the player settings.

![netflix speed control option computer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/netflix-speed-control-option-computer.jpg)

**Step 4:** The **Playback Speed** menu option would be added to the list of available options. If you want to raise or reduce your Netflix film's speed quickly, you may choose one of the five presets available.

(**Note**: You do not need to make any changes to your Netflix settings to use this function. However, if it isn't accessible by default, this might be due to Netflix not providing it in your region at this time. Alternatively, you can try logging out and back in again).

### Change Netflix Video Playback Speed on iPhone

**Step 1**: Start by opening the Netflix app on your iPhone and selecting the appropriate movies to view first.

**Step 2:** While you're viewing video material, you may tap anywhere on the screen to start bringing up the playback settings. You'll locate the **Speed** setting in this section, with the current playback speed shown in brackets next to it. To continue, tap on it.

![netflix video playback speed options iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/netflix-video-playback-speed-options-iphone.jpg)

**Step 3:** Then, all you have to do is set the playback speed using the slider. **Sliding the scale** to the right would accelerate the video, and moving the slider to the left would slow things down.

(**Note**: So, that's pretty much everything you needed to know about the playback speed function that Netflix has to offer. As expected, the default playback speed is set to 1x, which is precisely what you'd anticipate. You have the option of increasing the playback speed by 1.5x or decreasing it by 0.5x).

### Change Netflix Video Playback Speed on Android

**Step 1:** Once you've launched the Netflix application on your Android and started streaming your favorite movie, click on the **Speed** settings at the bottom-left corner.

![netflix video playback speed option android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/netflix-video-playback-speed-option-android.jpg)

**Step 2:** Choose the settings you prefer from the given options of 0.5x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, and 1.5x. That's all there's to it.

**(Note**: Don't refresh anything or launch the Netflix app again. Once you've applied the settings, the video will automatically start playing at the chosen speed).

## Part 4: Why Would You Change Netflix Playback Speeds?

Customers have "often wanted" variable-speed streaming, Netflix said while explaining when launching the feature. When it comes to movies and TV shows, why would anybody want to watch them more quickly or more slowly?

**Saving Your Precious Time**

There's a lot of debate over this, but it's already available on other services. Content providers almost universally praise YouTube's ability to let users speed up videos. DVD and Blu-ray players, on the other hand, often have this feature. Podcast players are available that allow you to listen to a whole episode on your commute.

**Binge-Watch Shows Quickly**

Netflix series, not movies, are better suited to quicker playback rates. Speeding up Netflix material means that you may finish a season in a matter of days rather than weeks. If you would like to catch up on the latest episodes of Daredevil, you may do so by increasing Netflix's playback rate to 1.5x.

Is there that much of a difference? You can view a 60-minute program in 40 minutes if it is sped up by 1.5x. You gain 100 minutes if you watch a 10-episode miniseries at 1.2x speed, with every episode clocking in at 60 minutes. Normal speed and 1.2x speed make no discernible change in the viewing experience.

**Match the Director's and Writer's Perspective**

Furthermore, every one of us has a unique perspective on the films we see. Although the intentions of both the directors and writers may be the same, audiences may perceive a production in various ways. Therefore, changing playback speed may be considered as making the movies or videos available for everyone to watch instantly and learn about the plots with a clearer understanding.

Netflix series, not movies, are better suited to quicker playback rates. Speeding up Netflix material means that you may finish a season in a matter of days rather than weeks. If you would like to catch up on the latest episodes of Daredevil, you may do so by increasing Netflix's playback rate to 1.5x.

Is there that much of a difference? You can view a 60-minute program in 40 minutes if it is sped up by 1.5x. You gain 100 minutes if you watch a 10-episode miniseries at 1.2x speed, with every episode clocking in at 60 minutes. Normal speed and 1.2x speed make no discernible change in the viewing experience.

**Match the Director's and Writer's Perspective**

Furthermore, every one of us has a unique perspective on the films we see. Although the intentions of both the directors and writers may be the same, audiences may perceive a production in various ways. Therefore, changing playback speed may be considered as making the movies or videos available for everyone to watch instantly and learn about the plots with a clearer understanding.

## Part 4: Why Would You Change Netflix Playback Speeds?

Customers have "often wanted" variable-speed streaming, Netflix said while explaining when launching the feature. When it comes to movies and TV shows, why would anybody want to watch them more quickly or more slowly?

**Saving Your Precious Time**

There's a lot of debate over this, but it's already available on other services. Content providers almost universally praise YouTube's ability to let users speed up videos. DVD and Blu-ray players, on the other hand, often have this feature. Podcast players are available that allow you to listen to a whole episode on your commute.

**Binge-Watch Shows Quickly**

Netflix series, not movies, are better suited to quicker playback rates. Speeding up Netflix material means that you may finish a season in a matter of days rather than weeks. If you would like to catch up on the latest episodes of Daredevil, you may do so by increasing Netflix's playback rate to 1.5x.

## FAQs About Changing Netflix Video Playback

**1\. How to Control Netflix Playback Speed On TV?**

Unfortunately, there seems to be no apparent solution to this. However, that's not to say there won't ever be in the future. With Netflix constantly updating and adding new features for everyone, you can't rule out a possibility.

**2\. What Speeds Can You Choose from Netflix Speed Control?**

Netflix introduced new playback settings that allow users to select the speed they wish to view content on their mobile devices or tablets. Users can stream Netflix movies at 0.5x or 0.75x pace on a smartphone or 1.25x or 1.5 speed.

**3\. Can I Play Netflix On 2X?**

Netflix allows you to adjust the playback speed of the video to 0.75x and 0.5x to the lowest, and from 1.25x to 1.50x to the fastest. However, it doesn't yet offer the 2x playback speed.
