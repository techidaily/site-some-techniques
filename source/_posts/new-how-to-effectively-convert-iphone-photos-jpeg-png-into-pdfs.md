## How to Convert JPG/PNG Image to PDF on an iPhone

iPhones, iPads or iPods all offer a feature many people don't know about that lets you convert image files into the PDF format.

### Method 1: Convert Photos to PDF with Apple’s Photos app

Before we proceed any further, it is important to note that you must have an iOS 9.0 or some more recent version of the iOS system installed on your device in order to be able to convert pictures to PDF with the Photos app. Launch the Photos app and tap on the Select button to choose which images you want to include in your PDF file.

In the next step, you should click on the Share icon and then select the Print option from the menu. You can use the 3D Touch to press a page thumbnail or zoom in on the preview thumbnail if your device doesn't have a 3D touch to create a PDF.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-photo-to-pdf-1.jpg)

Swipe the thumbnail to make sure that the PDF file you are creating looks exactly the way you want and hit Share to complete the PDF creation process. You can also select the location where you want your newly created PDF to be saved.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photo-to-pdf-2.jpg)

However, this method of creating PDF files will not allow you to select the page format, set a password to protect the document or fine-tune the image compression.

### Method 2: Use Photo to PDF Converter Apps for iPhone

iPhone owners in need of a more powerful tool for creating PDF files should consider using some of the apps that are available on the App Store. Here are my three favorite PDF converters for iOS devices that will allow you to create seamless PDF files from your iPhone photos.

#### 1\. [Able2Extract](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/able2extract-pdf-converter/id599991349?mt=8)
