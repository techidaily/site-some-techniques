## How to Optimize Your Video Watching: Enable/Disable PIP in Youtube iOS

Picture in Picture is now available on YouTube on all platforms and devices in the USA. You can manipulate this magic quality of your device to enjoy the experience. You can enable or disable PIP on iPhone or any other device anytime anywhere so that you use the feature desirably. When you enable PIP in any app on your device, it means that as you open any video, the video will automatically start on Picture in Picture mode.

After opening the video in PIP mode, you can do things around on the screen of your device as the video plays on a floating window. You will be able to resize and drag the window along as you carry along with other activities on your phone or PC.

## Part 1\. How to enable Picture in Picture for YouTube on iPhone

To enable PIP on iPhone on YouTube and use it better, you should be a premium YouTube subscriber. Picture in Picture on iPhone depends on the version of your phone. And here, I am going to tell you how to enable PIP on the latest versions of iPhones.

On iOS 14.5 or 14.6, here is a simple step-by-step guide to enable Picture in Picture for YouTube PIP. You will need two additional apps to do this: Shortcuts and Scriptable. And both are freely accessible from the App Store.

1. Go to **Settings** of your device
2. Tap the **Shortcut** extension in Settings
3. Turn on **Allow Untrusted Shortcuts**. If this option is not available for your device, go to **Screen Time extension** and disable any screen time restrictions. So, you will proceed successfully.

![enable pip on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-for-youtube-on-iphone-1.jpg)

1. If you require a **YouTube PIP** shortcut app on your device to proceed, you can download it from App Store or [the Shortcuts Gallery browser](https://shortcutsgallery.com/shortcuts/youtube-pip/) and then add it to your Shortcut Library.
2. Open the **YouTube PIP** Shortcut and tap **Get Shortcut** on the App. You will be redirected to the shortcut application on your phone. If you don't have the shortcut application, you can download it from the App Store.

1. Tap **Allow Untrusted Shortcuts** in the Shortcut Application on your device
2. Now go to the actual YouTube App and start to play a video
3. As the video plays, tap on the **Share icon** then scroll to the right end of the list of sharing options for platforms and Apps. Tap the **More icon** at the right end.
