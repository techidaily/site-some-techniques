## How-To: Seamless Setup of iFunny Meme Toolkit

The iFunny meme app is an Android app that is designed for the specific purpose of providing funny photos, memes, and apps that you can download and share. It is a user-generated platform that allows users to download and upload funny images to the platform. It is a social media platform that is dedicated to the sharing of funny images and comes complete with all features that you would expect on a social media sharing site such as the ability to add additional content like comments, posts, and messages to other users.

When you first open the app or access the online version, you will see different types of memes displayed on the screen and you can just scroll down to find the meme that you would like to use. If you are looking for a specific meme, you can use the search tab and enter a keyword or tag to find the meme. There is also a section that displays the memes that are currently trending.

Here, we will look at iFunny and how you can use it to find the memes that you would like to use.

The “Collective” tab also features some of the best memes created and posted recently, but it offers you the chance to search for the memes, GIFs, photos, and videos using various categories. This is the best option when looking for a very specific GIF.

The “Subscribe” tab is useful when you want to engage with other users on the app. Here, you will also find options to chat with other uses, like and comment on their memes

The “Explore” tab lists all the mems on the platform, neatly arranged in various categories. Since the content is user generated, there is no limit to the memes that you can find and download.
