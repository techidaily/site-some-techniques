## Part 2: Our Favorite Music Videos Cameras

There are all sorts of cameras on the market, but some stand out as the best. Out of the ten cameras that we explored above, we think that these 2 are the best cameras to shoot music videos.

### 1\. [PANASONIC LUMIX ZS200](https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-DC-ZS200K-Megapixel-VARIO-ELMAR-Stabilization/dp/B079QYMWZX/ref=sr%5F1%5F5?crid=3EDB6B2L8IOTM&keywords=panasonic+lumix+dmc-lx5&qid=1583239342&sprefix=Panasonic+Lumix+DMC-LX5%2Caps%2C364&sr=8-5)

No matter which website you go to, you will find that the Lumix ZS200 is often listed among the best of what is available on the market today (in 2021, when this article was written).

Panasonic has been a brand long sought out by camera enthusiasts, and this one is no different. With state of [the art 4k technology](https://www.creativebloq.com/computer-arts/what-does-4k-mean-you-51411622), this stands out as one of the best 4k cameras for music videos, hands down.

### 2\. [Blackmagic Design Digital Cinema Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Blackmagic-Design-Digital-EF-Mount-CINECAMURSAM40K/dp/B00WNFHZB2/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?crid=1ZUDSZ3Y4I2WE&keywords=blackmagic+design+ursa+mini+4k&qid=1583239166&sprefix=Blackmagic+Design+URSA+%2Caps%2C419&sr=8-3)

This high-end camera is going to be pricey for you, but its mini handheld design makes it simple for you to get all of the best shots. This 4k camera is going to give you the best look for your videos every time.

## Part 3: Music Video Camera FAQs

1\. **What is the best 4k camera for music videos?**

If you want a specific 4k camcorder, then the Panasonic HC-X1 4K UHD Camcorder is your best bet. This camera supports 4k, HD, UHD, FHD, and a variety of other options. It’s larger than many of the cameras and camcorders that are listed here, but it is specially designed for this sort of work. You can also simultaneously record to two different memory cards; it has 2 audio XLRs and multiple other ports for optimum audiovisual recording.

2\.   **What equipment is needed for a music video?**

If you’re looking to put together a kit so that you can have a great music video, then you want to be sure that you have the right equipment. Here’s a quick list.

* The right camera(s)
* [Tripods for camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
* A camera light
* 3 way lighting (at the very least; you can use multiple lighting setups as well)
* Shotgun microphones
* Boom mic setup with pole and shock mount
* Audio cables and recorder(s)
* XLR cables (audio cables)
* Headphones (so you can adjust sound levels more accurately)
* Extra batteries, memory cards, and other equipment, so your gear doesn’t die while you’re filming.

You may also need other materials if you’re working in a particular environment. Sit down with your crew and work out what is essential and what you may not need in terms of your equipment.

3\.   **What is the best lens for shooting music videos?**

The [Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM Lens](https://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-135mm-f-2.0-L-USM-Lens-Review.aspx) is one of the best lenses on the market for shooting music videos. It has an UltraSonic motor, 135mm focal length, and a focus distance of 3 feet. You can also get it with a polarizer or a UV Protection Filter.

The speed and versatility of this lens allows you to get some beautiful video, and it works with most models of camera that we’ve discussed in this article.

4\.   **How long does it take to make a music video?**

It depends on exactly what it is that you are doing in the video. Most of the time, artists have some sort of idea as to what their main concept will be in the video, and who they want to work with. Otherwise, the record label will be in charge of such things. In general, this depends on the song being recorded and what sort of budget is being worked with.

On average, it takes around **two weeks** to get everything recorded and ready to go; it could take longer on the front end and back end when it comes to organizing and scheduling.

## Part 3: Music Video Camera FAQs

1\. **What is the best 4k camera for music videos?**

If you want a specific 4k camcorder, then the Panasonic HC-X1 4K UHD Camcorder is your best bet. This camera supports 4k, HD, UHD, FHD, and a variety of other options. It’s larger than many of the cameras and camcorders that are listed here, but it is specially designed for this sort of work. You can also simultaneously record to two different memory cards; it has 2 audio XLRs and multiple other ports for optimum audiovisual recording.

2\.   **What equipment is needed for a music video?**

If you’re looking to put together a kit so that you can have a great music video, then you want to be sure that you have the right equipment. Here’s a quick list.

* The right camera(s)
* [Tripods for camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
* A camera light
* 3 way lighting (at the very least; you can use multiple lighting setups as well)
* Shotgun microphones
* Boom mic setup with pole and shock mount
* Audio cables and recorder(s)
* XLR cables (audio cables)
* Headphones (so you can adjust sound levels more accurately)
* Extra batteries, memory cards, and other equipment, so your gear doesn’t die while you’re filming.

You may also need other materials if you’re working in a particular environment. Sit down with your crew and work out what is essential and what you may not need in terms of your equipment.

3\.   **What is the best lens for shooting music videos?**

The [Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM Lens](https://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-135mm-f-2.0-L-USM-Lens-Review.aspx) is one of the best lenses on the market for shooting music videos. It has an UltraSonic motor, 135mm focal length, and a focus distance of 3 feet. You can also get it with a polarizer or a UV Protection Filter.

The speed and versatility of this lens allows you to get some beautiful video, and it works with most models of camera that we’ve discussed in this article.

4\.   **How long does it take to make a music video?**

It depends on exactly what it is that you are doing in the video. Most of the time, artists have some sort of idea as to what their main concept will be in the video, and who they want to work with. Otherwise, the record label will be in charge of such things. In general, this depends on the song being recorded and what sort of budget is being worked with.

On average, it takes around **two weeks** to get everything recorded and ready to go; it could take longer on the front end and back end when it comes to organizing and scheduling.
