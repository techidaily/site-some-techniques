## Part 1\. What Is a Podcast Visualizer?

A podcast visualizer can convert your podcast into animated, engaging videos to promote on social media. It is in the form of spectrums, lines, shapes, and animated blobs. A visualizer follows the rhythm, loudness, and frequency of the audio.

![what is a podcast visualizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-visualizer-1.jpg)

Most of the visualizers were developed back in the mid-70s for music. That was when there was no correlation between audio and video components.

So what they do is to get a visual life to the audio files. For example, the blobs of colors dance around the screen and stop dancing at the end of the audio. In this way, users can work on different input voices simultaneously. Here are a few critical factors by which we picked the best podcast visualizers.

## Part 2\. How We Tested and Picked Out the Best Podcast Visualizer?

We kept a few key factors in mind to list the best podcast visualizers. The main key factors are discussed below.

* **Interface:** the editing process becomes much easier with a user-friendly interface. Not only that but also the modernity of the interface also matters. A user should enjoy using the software.
* **Animations:** The output of the editing process is mainly dependent upon the usage of animations. Animation tools are always supportive of enhancing the overall output result. Stickers, sound waves, and texts are crucial when making a podcast visualizer.
* **Pricing:** Pricing of software matters a lot. We made sure to include all the software worth spending on and give value-added features.
* **Customer Service:** Customer service matters significantly in buying software. Quick response from the company makes it easier for the users to solve their problems.
* **Free Plans and Trials:** the software that provides free plans and trials are trustworthy. So before buying software, you know pre hand what features you will buy.
* **User Reviews and Ratings:** Much of the online market is based on the reviews and ratings of current users. It helps us make up our minds to buy a product.

Part 1\. What Is a Podcast Visualizer?

A podcast visualizer can convert your podcast into animated, engaging videos to promote on social media. It is in the form of spectrums, lines, shapes, and animated blobs. A visualizer follows the rhythm, loudness, and frequency of the audio.

![what is a podcast visualizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-visualizer-1.jpg)

Most of the visualizers were developed back in the mid-70s for music. That was when there was no correlation between audio and video components.

So what they do is to get a visual life to the audio files. For example, the blobs of colors dance around the screen and stop dancing at the end of the audio. In this way, users can work on different input voices simultaneously. Here are a few critical factors by which we picked the best podcast visualizers.

## Part 2\. How We Tested and Picked Out the Best Podcast Visualizer?
