**Video:** The Bublcam being a 360 degree camera unit has power to capture whole world surrounding us in a single shot. There are two different output sizes for videos captured by Bublcam spherical camera i.e. 1080p at 30fps, 1440 at 15fps. Although none of these will give you full HD experience, size ranges of captured videos are nominal that can be stored easily and images can also be stretched out up to 4 times spaces. If you set your video mode to 1440p video setting then it will lead to decent clarity and wonderful image brightness.
