### What is Fade?

You may use fades to gently raise or lower the level at the beginning or conclusion of audio events or audio clips and to make transitions seem seamless. You may gradually raise or lower the level of audio events or audio clips by using fade ins and fade outs. Event-based or clip-based fade ins and fade outs are also possible. In this situation, the fade feature in a sequencer or audio editor may often be utilized swiftly and efficiently.

A video transition is comparable to an audio fade. There is often a sweet spot when the fading truly disappears. You often have a choice of fade curves with fade functions. Using the faders on a mixer, whether it be hardware or software, is the most natural method to fade. All current software sequencers will capture your motions, allowing you to modify, fade, and tune until you find the perfect rhythm. Keep fade-ins brief in most situations unless you're going for a specific impact.

### What is Crossfade?

Adding an audio transition between two adjacent audio clips on the same track creates a crossfade. You may apply a crossfade transition to either end of a single clip to have it fade in or fade out. A crossfade is the technique of fading one piece of audio out while also fading the other one in, unlike a fade, which is conducted on only one piece of audio. The sound engine's maximum crossfade time when switching from Sound A to Sound B is equal to half the duration of Audio File A.

You may use crossfades to provide seamless transitions between several audio events on the same track. Crossfading is always depending on events. You may manually carry out a crossfade, just as with fades. The two songs' blended versions must be routed to two distinct sets of faders. Only when the subsequent events or their corresponding clips overlap can crossfades be made. This is typically used in recording to make one track on an album fade into or blend with the next. When done well, it has a fantastic impact.

## Part 2\. How to Crossfade Audio

Because a crossfade requires a bit more work than a fade, it's important to consider the assistance your sequencer or audio editor may provide. Most include a crossfade feature, and some, once more, give users a choice of curvature. Additionally, you may be able to utilize one fade-in curve and a second one for the fade-out.

### 1\. Crossfade audio on Smartphone

The crossfade function in Spotify for Android and iOS ensures that your music never stops playing by removing the pause between songs. A crossfade is a musical effect in which the sound of one track begins to fade out and the sound of the following song begins to fade in.

Due to the prevalence of transitions in album tracks, Spotify by default does not provide Crossfade.

**Step to crossfade audio with Spotify:**

Step1 Open the Spotify app on your Android smartphone first. As shown in the picture below, you must now press on the Settings gear icon.

![press settings spotify app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-settings-spotify-app.jpg)

Step2 The Playback section may be found on the Settings page. Scroll down to the "Crossfade" section on iOS. Toggle the option to the "On" position by tapping it. To choose the crossfade length on Android, tap and move the slider. Alternatively, drag the slider all the way to the left to turn off the crossfade.

![crossfade audio spotify app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossfade-audio-spotify-app.jpg)

Step3 You may crossfade tracks on Spotify using this method. The app's built-in audio normalization tool, which can quickly balance mild and loud music for a more even sound experience, is available to Spotify Premium customers. Obviously, you won't get much in the way of beat matching, but at least the song will continue playing continuously.
