* **Cost**: Free
* **Supported integrations**: Google products like Google Home and Google Assistant.
* **Supported OS**: [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-podcasts/id1398000105) (iOS), [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.podcasts&gl=US) (Android), [Web](https://podcasts.google.com/)

The podcasts available in the app were originally in Google Play Music. But after its discontinuation in 2020, the podcasts have moved to this separate platform.
