## Foundations in Digital Visual Narratives

If you're thinking, "What is motion graphics?" let me explain that they are a particular kind of animation. It may be described as a hybrid of graphic design and animation. In most cases, motion graphics aim to present information using visual or animated texts to achieve a particular communication purpose. Motion graphics now have a far wider variety of applications because of technological advancements and the prevalence of screens in everyday objects. What was used to deliver technical knowledge and create the tone for a tale today has a variety of uses.

## What is Motion Graphics

Motion graphics is a fantastic tool for presenting stories and mixing animation and graphic design. Animation design is more memorable to viewers than static visuals because it employs not just straightforward visual components like text, forms, or images but also activates audio receptors to express concepts. Animation is motion graphics, although text plays a big part in them. Animated graphic design is what it is. There has been discussion over the boundary between motion graphics and full animation since motion graphics first appeared on the scene.

Stunning motion graphics animation for brand apps and web platforms conveys a lot of information in a short, straightforward, aesthetically appealing film while showcasing complex images, thoughts, and concepts. As a result, it aids in quickly delivering a message and effortlessly grabbing and holding the audience's attention. Any field you choose, including business, marketing, IT solutions, the film industry, education, healthcare, social networks, or entertainment, can benefit from excellent animation design.
