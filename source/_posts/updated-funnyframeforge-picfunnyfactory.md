## Part 3: Related FAQs

### 1\. How do I make a meme text post?

Any of the above methodology can be used to the creation of text memes. You may use a meme generator to generate the meme by opening it, choosing a template of a solid color, and then adding text. If you write in your text, it will become a meme that only exists in text. Because these tools are skilled at modifying media, it is possible to do it on both [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and IMGFlip, where making memes is simple. Unlike Filmora, which offers an endless number of meme-making options, IMGFlip has certain limitations.
