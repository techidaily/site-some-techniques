VIRB Ultra 30 has been developed with colour LCD screen that can assist users in live preview. The overall dimension of touch screen is 1.75 inch where you can access all photo and video setting icons so easily.

VIRB Ultra 30 has been developed with colour LCD screen that can assist users in live preview.
