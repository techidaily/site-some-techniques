## What Is Google AR Sticker?

Think of stickers that you can put on images or videos. However, these stickers are in 3D. Furthermore, they look like they are actually in the environment or they are a part of your body. However, you can only see them through a camera lens.

You can look at Pokemon Go to understand it better. The game allows you to "place" your Pokemon in the real world and take photos of them. Google AR stickers are like that, except the stickers are not strictly only Pokemon. There are letters, food, Stranger Things characters, and more!

## History of Google AR Sticker

Back in 2017, virtual reality and augmented reality received an increase in interest. While these technologies weren't really new, it was at this time that they became common. Apps like Snapchat included AR stickers that allowed users to take photos and videos with their favorite fictional characters and such. Google hopped on the trend by incorporating AR stickers into its smartphone, Pixel 2.

The thing is that it did not last long. Ever since Google launched its Pixel 4a in 2020, they no longer provided AR stickers. The camera of the new devices is not compatible with AR stickers, Playground, and Playmoji. And that's the end of Google AR Stickers.

Owners of older Pixel models should not worry since the devices' hardware isn't changed. Thus, they will continue to support Playground, the app needed to use Google AR Stickers.

## How To Use Google Playground AR Stickers on Pixel 4 and Earlier

As mentioned above, older Pixel models still have Google Playground support. These devices are Pixel 4 and earlier. Meanwhile, Playmojis (3D AR Stickers) are available only for Pixel 3, 3a, and 4.

Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to use this feature:

Step1 Ensure you have Android 8.1 (Oreo) installed on your Pixel. Also, ensure the Google Camera app is updated.

Step2 Launch the Google Camera app.

Step3 Tap **"**More" > "Playground."

Step4 Select "Stickers" > "Playmoji" or "Stickers."

Step5 Tap the AR Sticker or Playmoji that you want to use.

Step6 Touch and hold, and drag the AR sticker where you want it to be on the photo or video. Adjust the sticker as needed.

![dragging star wars sticker to camera screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-ar-stickers-6.jpg)

Step7 Tap "Capture" to take a photo. If in video mode, touch and hold "Capture" instead.

## Filmora AR Camera â€“ Great Alternative to Google AR Stickers

Suppose you own a Google Pixel 4a or a later model, and you want to try augmented reality photos and videos. Sadly, you can't use Google's own AR stickers. But don't worry. There's a great alternative! You can use Filmora AR Camera on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for Mobile instead. It's an application that lets you add AR stickers to your photos and videos.

## People Also Ask

Do you still want to know more about AR stickers? It's understandable since "augmented reality" sounds very advanced and complex. Here are some FAQs about it to make you more informed about the subject.

**Q1\. What Are AR Stickers?**

AR stickers are augmented reality image effects you can add to improve photos or videos. They can be static images or animations. Some examples are eyeglasses, bunny headbands, hats, beards, or even animals or characters.

The application that offers it maps your face or the environment in the video and tracks movements. With that, they make it seem like the AR sticker is real instead of a virtual object.

Let's suppose you added AR eyeglasses to the video you are recording. When you move, the eyeglasses will follow your eyes instead of staying where they originally were.

**Q2\. Can You Use AR Without an App?**

Perhaps you don't want to install custom AR apps. That's not new. According to some studies, engagement drops by 50% when users need to download. So, some developers chose the WebAR path instead.

WebAR uses web technologies to let users experience augmented reality. All you need is a phone or any device with a camera and a web browser. Since most modern browsers and operating systems already support AR, WebAR makes the experience so accessible.

**Q3\. Are AR Apps Safe?**

AR Apps can be dangerous, but not all of them are. Keep in mind that AR apps can see what you are doing in real-time. If that information falls into the wrong hands, you may end up in trouble.

Vendors can also add malware or other things to the apps. So it's necessary that you always stay vigilant. As much as possible, download AR apps from vendors with a good reputation. That's how you ensure the app is not doing something nasty behind your back.

## Conclusion

Google AR Stickers are great for enhancing your photos and videos. Too bad it's no longer available on newer Pixel devices. Luckily, other apps are available on the market, and they're available on more platforms. For example, Wondershare Filmora for Mobile has an AR Camera feature. It lets you add AR stickers to your photos and videos, then combine and edit them. The selection of AR effects is also wide. So, you can have loads of fun creating content using Filmora for Mobile.
