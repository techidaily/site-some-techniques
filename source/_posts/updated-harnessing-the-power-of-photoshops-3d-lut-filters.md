3D LUT (Look-Up-Table) is a function key that maps a given color space to another. Technically, LUTs are used for complex processes such as converting an image shot from a Canon Log profile and making it more enticing or converting one image color space to its better version.

Working with LUTs, there are two types; 3D LUT and 1D LUT. The difference is that the former provides room for complex color operations, whereas the latter has limitations on the number of color operations.

Here are more differences between 3D and 1D LUTs:

##### 3D LUT

It Places luma and color in a 3D (Cube) form; hence very easy to work with.

The output values are not from each respective combination in a color space.

It is a bit complex when customizing the basic settings such as contrast and white balance. Usually, the final result becomes remarkable.

##### 1D LUT

The color and luma are placed in a 1D; hence quite not easy to work on.

It contains a clear value of the outputs and on the basis of the bit depth, i.e., 1024 values in a 10 - bit.

It is a walk in the park when it comes to adjustments to the basic settings such as contrast, brightness, and white balance. But, the resulting output will be mid.

The output values are not from each respective combination in a color space.

It is a bit complex when customizing the basic settings such as contrast and white balance. Usually, the final result becomes remarkable.

##### 1D LUT

The color and luma are placed in a 1D; hence quite not easy to work on.

It contains a clear value of the outputs and on the basis of the bit depth, i.e., 1024 values in a 10 - bit.

It is a walk in the park when it comes to adjustments to the basic settings such as contrast, brightness, and white balance. But, the resulting output will be mid.

Wrapping up the differences, 3D LUTs are essential for colorists and editors since they can carry out tons of color customizations. Therefore, they can make their work uniquely stunning.

Working with LUTs, there are two types; 3D LUT and 1D LUT. The difference is that the former provides room for complex color operations, whereas the latter has limitations on the number of color operations.

Here are more differences between 3D and 1D LUTs:

##### 3D LUT

It Places luma and color in a 3D (Cube) form; hence very easy to work with.

The output values are not from each respective combination in a color space.

It is a bit complex when customizing the basic settings such as contrast and white balance. Usually, the final result becomes remarkable.

##### 1D LUT

The color and luma are placed in a 1D; hence quite not easy to work on.

It contains a clear value of the outputs and on the basis of the bit depth, i.e., 1024 values in a 10 - bit.

It is a walk in the park when it comes to adjustments to the basic settings such as contrast, brightness, and white balance. But, the resulting output will be mid.

Wrapping up the differences, 3D LUTs are essential for colorists and editors since they can carry out tons of color customizations. Therefore, they can make their work uniquely stunning.

## How to Import 3D LUT to Photoshop

There are some 3D LUTs that Adobe Photoshop provides. Usually, these LUTs are limited and are not very effective when working on major projects. Most people, therefore, prefer to add their own 3D LUTs to Photoshop.

There are two ways to import 3D LUT to Photoshop; Adding LUTs to a specific project and Installing LUTs.

Before applying any of the two methods, you need to ensure you have your LUTs right there. You can purchase them or get them for free. Download them to your computer device.

#### Method 1\. Adding LUTs to a Particular Project

This first step is undemanding since you only have to locate a given LUT and then directly incorporate it into your project.

![how to use 3d lut in photoshop - open lut folder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/3d-lut-photoshop-4.jpg)

### Step 2\. Create a new Folder

After accessing your 3D LUTs on your computer, you need to create a new folder that will contain your new LUTs. Right-click, then click on “New folder.” Name the folder based on your preference.

### Step 3\. Copy and Paste your LUTs

Copy your LUTs and paste them to the folder you have just created.

### Step 4\. Restart Photoshop

Lastly, restart your Photoshop app. You can access your new files by clicking “Color Lookup” > “Adjustment layer.” Usually, the files are saved as .cube files.

### Step 1\. Open your Project Image

First, go to your Photoshop app and add your photo.

### Step 2\. Open the Adjustment Panel
