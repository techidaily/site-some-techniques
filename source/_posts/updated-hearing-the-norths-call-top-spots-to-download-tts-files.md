[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 First, download Filmora’s latest version from the official website. Download the app from the [**Play Store**](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) or [**App Store**](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) if you are a mobile user.
