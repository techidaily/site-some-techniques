Step 9: Click on the blurred mosaic layer and go to the upper left side of your screen, where you'll see that you have some options that allow you to adjust your blur effect.

Step 10: You'll see six different Mosaics that you can choose from; select the pixelated option. Choosing this option will immediately pixelate the face with the mosaic layer.
