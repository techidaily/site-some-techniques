Awesome 4K resolution and perfect action support are some of the killer features of Xiaomi Yi and that is why it is also known as GoPro Killer cam unit. You can capture stills at 12MP capabilities where touch sensitive display makes everything much easier to access. If you start shooting at 1080p then GoPro Killer will offer you advanced stabilization abilities. This device is well known for its excellent battery life and you can buy it at reasonable price range. But the sad part is that it lacks somewhere in audio recording abilities and also cannot be used underwater. So if you are an adventure sports lover then you must check for any other option.

Awesome 4K resolution and perfect action support are some of the killer features of Xiaomi Yi and that is why it is also known as GoPro Killer cam unit. You can capture stills at 12MP capabilities where touch sensitive display makes everything much easier to access.

This device is well known for its excellent battery life and you can buy it at reasonable price range. But the sad part is that it lacks somewhere in audio recording abilities and also cannot be used underwater. So if you are an adventure sports lover then you must check for any other option.

Awesome 4K resolution and perfect action support are some of the killer features of Xiaomi Yi and that is why it is also known as GoPro Killer cam unit. You can capture stills at 12MP capabilities where touch sensitive display makes everything much easier to access.

This device is well known for its excellent battery life and you can buy it at reasonable price range. But the sad part is that it lacks somewhere in audio recording abilities and also cannot be used underwater. So if you are an adventure sports lover then you must check for any other option.

Awesome 4K resolution and perfect action support are some of the killer features of Xiaomi Yi and that is why it is also known as GoPro Killer cam unit. You can capture stills at 12MP capabilities where touch sensitive display makes everything much easier to access. If you start shooting at 1080p then GoPro Killer will offer you advanced stabilization abilities. This device is well known for its excellent battery life and you can buy it at reasonable price range. But the sad part is that it lacks somewhere in audio recording abilities and also cannot be used underwater. So if you are an adventure sports lover then you must check for any other option.
