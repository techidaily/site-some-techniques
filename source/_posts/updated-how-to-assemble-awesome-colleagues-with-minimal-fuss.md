### 01**Step 1\. Open Modes**

First of all, open your Insta Story and open the Modes menu (usually found on the left-hand side of the screen.) You can play around with the features here or skip it entirely if you want the background to be an image.

For the first method, we were mainly free-forming our **Instagram Collage**. The options were quite limited too.

### 02**Step 2\. Select Images from Camera Roll**

Like before, you have the option of taking live photographs or using ones that were already taken by picking them out from your camera roll.

For our purposes, we’ve decided to make our **Instagram Collage** from images that were already in our camera roll.

### 03**Step 3\. Select Images One by One**

Unlike the previous method, you’ll have to select images one by one (so that you can specify the placement of each photograph.) So, expect to repeat this step a couple of times based on the layout you choose.

So, if you find that one isn’t working for you (or you’re looking for a very specific kind of aesthetic), then it might be helpful to have more than one or the other.

In this tutorial, we’ll be teaching you all of the different Instagram methods (as well as introducing some different third-party apps you can consider.)

03 [10 Trendy Apps To Create Collages For Instagram](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on Making a Collage on Instagram**

First, we’ll be showing you how to make the most basic **Instagram Story Collage** — or, a form of it anyway This is a quick one, but it might not be one that you’ve heard of before. Since it’s quite obscure, and the use is limited. To start off this tutorial, by the way, we’re heading straight to Insta Story

### 01**Step 1\. Open Modes**

First of all, open your Insta Story and open the Modes menu (usually found on the left-hand side of the screen.) You can play around with the features here or skip it entirely if you want the background to be an image.

![Open Insta Story to Make Instagram Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage1.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Create Collage on Insta**

For the sake of simplicity, we’ll be making a basic **Instagram Story Collage** with a flat background. This is possible by clicking the ‘Create’ Mode (found at the very top of the side-menu on the left.)

![Create an Instagram Story Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Choose Images for Insta Story Collage**

Next, it’s time to add pictures. You can do this by selecting the ‘Camera Roll’ function on the bottom-left-hand corner of the screen.

![Open Device Camera Roll](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage3.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Select Images for Instagram Collage**

Select the photos that you want to use for your **Insta Story Collage** and click the ‘Next’ arrow that can be found on the bottom right-hand corner of the interface.

![Select Images and Create Insta Story Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage4.png)

### 05**Step 5\. Edit and Post Instagram Collage**

With this done, you can now edit and post your collage on your Instagram Story As you can see, the app automatically supplies a flat background that matches the look of your chosen images, so it’s quite useful

![Edit and Post Insta Story Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage5.png)

## Part 2 **Easy Steps on Making a Collage on Instagram Story Using the Layout Mode**

For the first method, we were mainly free-forming our **Instagram Collage**. The options were quite limited too. However, with this next method, which makes use of the ‘Layout’ Mode on Insta Story, you’ll be able to control the exact look of your **Instagram Collage** before posting it onto your Insta Story

### 01**Step 1\. Open Layout Mode**

To start off, select ‘Layout’ mode from the side-menu on the left.

![Instagram Collage with Layout Mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage6.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Select Images from Camera Roll**

Like before, you have the option of taking live photographs or using ones that were already taken by picking them out from your camera roll.

For our purposes, we’ve decided to make our **Instagram Collage** from images that were already in our camera roll.

![Open Device Cameral Roll](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage7.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Select Images One by One**

Unlike the previous method, you’ll have to select images one by one (so that you can specify the placement of each photograph.) So, expect to repeat this step a couple of times based on the layout you choose.

![Select Images for Instagram Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-trick-on-how-to-instagram-collage8.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Edit and Post Collage on Instagram**
