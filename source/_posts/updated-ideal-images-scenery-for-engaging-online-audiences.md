## Part I. 4 tips to help you choose a live-streaming background

### 1\. Pure color background

You can choose any clean and solid color wall, curtain, or wallpaper as a background for your live stream. But make sure that it is neat enough and has a broad field of vision. Moreover, there is no exposure to it.

It will be best to choose one that can easily match any color. But remember, do not use pure white backgrounds as they are too reflective, which is not suitable for the vision of your stream as it affects the highlight of the streamer and the products very much.

Another way is to choose well-organized and clean shelves as a background. For example, you can set a bookshelf as your background if you have to join some live business meetings or academic sessions.

Even if you are a seller showcasing his products during a live stream, you can select this type of background by placing the products you will introduce on any clean shelf. It will help you to make the viewer experience much better.

### 3\. The real scene with warm decoration

The realistic scenes with warm decorations can also be a beautiful background for your streams. They make your relationship with the viewers much more friendly and familiar. In other words, they give your stream a natural look, which fascinates the viewers very much.
