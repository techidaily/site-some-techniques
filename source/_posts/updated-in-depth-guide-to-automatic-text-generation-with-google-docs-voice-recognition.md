### Q1: Can you use Google Docs on speech to text mobile?

Yes, you can. Download Gboard on your android device to avail the feature. Once done, launch the Google Docs app. Then, touch and hold the microphone on your keyboard. You can start transcribing after the words Speak Now appear on your screen. However, not all android versions offer the service. Therefore, check your device's compatibility by accessing Google PlayStore.

### Q2: Can you use Google Docs speech to text offline?

Unfortunately, no. The speech to text google docs is only available online since it operates on the Google Cloud Services platform. In addition, you need to have the chrome web browser on your device to use the service, which requires an online connection.
