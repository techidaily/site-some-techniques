## What is a photomontage?

Unlike the typical photograph with a single pic, a photomontage encompasses several photos collaged together. It doesn’t matter the number of photos it contains. You can also use a variety of locations to take photos. Way back, photographers composed photo montage images by cutting, gluing, and arranging pieces together. However, the advent of computers has shifted the dimension of making a photo montage. Several apps are available for not only montaging your photos, but also editing them for a splendid outcome.

## Things to pay attention to before making a PhotoMontage

Let’s check out what to consider in the quest to make a photo montage.

### i) What’s your subject?

Ask yourself what you intend to express with your photomontage. Pick a subject that’s static and simple. You should also consider the ease of adding more photos if you need to. Plan out how many photos you want to include in your montage as well.

### ii) Keep it real

Don’t exaggerate your work, but keep it real. At a glance, related collage photos will make sense. Likewise, check the photos you are importing into your editing program. It’s great to use easily editable clips.

### iii) Be adventurous

Making a photomontage need not be plain. Go out of your way and add some creativity as well. Have in mind what you want to create in advance to avoid distractions. However, add all the necessary elements and just let it be fun.

Photos of different sizes would do better than using the same size. So, be ready to resize some clips to make a perfect fit in each corner.

### vi) Get a quality photomontage tool

The choice of a tool is also paramount. Opt for a tool that has an intuitive user interface. Likewise, it should be able to edit your photos and add any necessary effects to make your photo montage look splendid.

### #5\. Man Ray – Black Widow

Man Ray worked on several paintings, like Larmes and Kiki de Montparnasse. The most renowned was the "Black Widow" photo montage that he created in 2015\. This artwork fetched him about $5.8 million. Most of his works are represented at the Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. He was an American visual artist who was a great contributor to the Dada movement. Besides photography, Man Ray was also into poetry, sculpture, design, and film.

Closing Thoughts:

Move away from the general form of photography and throw in some artistic feeling. The best way to make a photo montage is to find the perfect tool. Besides, you should also pay attention to other aspects, like being adventurous and keeping it real.
