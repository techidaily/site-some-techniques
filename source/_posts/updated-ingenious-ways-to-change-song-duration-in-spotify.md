## Ingenious Ways to Change Song Duration in Spotify

While listening to songs has become relatively easy nowadays with so many audio streaming platforms like Spotify available, controlling their specifications has yet to. However, for many users, this is a significant concern.

After all, faster-paced songs are more engaging and high-energy, invoking feelings of fun and excitement in people. This is one of the reasons why the sped-up songs on videos posted on social media platforms like TikTok are so catchy and shareable.

If you want a fast-paced song version but not necessarily a pre-made remix with extra effects, manually speeding it up should help**.**

If that is a concern for you, worry not. This post will detail the best solutions and software to **speed up music on Spotify** using its rich library of songs, with steps. Let's continue.

## Part I. How to Speed Up Songs on Spotify?

Firstly, consider if the process of **changing a song's speed on Spotify** is directly applicable to the platform. The answer to that is no. As of the time of this writing, Spotify or any of the well-known online audio streaming sites still need to offer the music playback speed adjustment feature. This applies to both web and mobile versions while streaming songs.

While there is no direct function for adjusting Spotify songs or even podcasts' playback speed, you can use the [Spotify Playback Speed Access](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-playback-speed-ac/cgbihpjbhpdfbdckcabcniojdhcgblhd) of Spotify Web Player. This is a Google Chrome extension that allows users the ability to **speed up Spotify songs**, mainly on the web app version.

However, this extension was last updated in October 2019\. So, while using it, you might notice some issues.

### Method 1: Change Playback Speed on Spotify Web Player

## Part II. How to Change Speed of Audio on Spotify for Further Video Editing- Full Guide

When it comes to Spotify and its users, many utilize the software for more than just music playback or listening to podcasts. Some users require songs from worldwide creators available on Spotify for video editing. This is because of the vast library of high-quality music types on the software.
