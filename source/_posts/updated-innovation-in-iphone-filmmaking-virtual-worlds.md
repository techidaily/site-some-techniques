The best thing to know is that it is available for free but sad part is its ability to capture small videos only.

 **2\. YouTube:**

The all reality stuff can be experienced with this specially designed application for iOS; install it on your device and then type #360video. Soon you will find an VR icon in your search results, just strap on viewer to go through all 2D online stuff using your headset and enjoy the virtual reality. It is also available for free but you need to consume memory of your phone to download and install it.

 **3\. NYT VR ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/nyt-vr-virtual-reality-stories/id1028562337) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.im360nytvr&hl)):**

Within last few months, the New York Time is boosting and expanding all its online and print stories that are working with its specially designed VR app. It is designed to work with Google Cardboards and give awesome results at output. The best part to know is that it comes with smartphone viewing mode and sad thing is that you need to buy Google Cardboards to run this app. Available for free.

 **4\. Orbulus ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vr-mojo-orbulus-special-edition/id998882503) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.VRCraftworks.Orbulus&hl)):**

This app is same as that of Oculus Photo Viewer, it works with iOS and Cardboards to give awesome 360 degree view. Orbulus is wonderful choice for still images as well as spherical videos and it makes everything much easier for the user.

### Conclusion

There are no limitations to the world of 360 degree video recording and iOS users are now able to enjoy all amazing stuff on their own device without making investment on costly gears. If you are one of the VR content lover then it is right time to order your latest accessory along with VR app designed for iPhone and enter into the world of adventure.
